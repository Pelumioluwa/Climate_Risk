The EU has agreed ambitious \\ntargets for 2030 regarding GHG emission reductions, renewable energy and energy \\nefficiency1, and has approved rules on GHG emissions from land use as well as emissions \\ntargets for cars and vans. In 2018 the Commission published its strategic long -term vision for \\na prosperous, modern , competitive and climate -neutral economy by 2050.2 \\nCompanies and financial institutions have a critical role to play in the transition to a low -\\ncarbon and climate -resilient economy. Firstly, an additional annual investment of €180 \\nbillion is already neede d to meet the EU’s energy and climate 2030 targets, and further funds \\nwill be needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Many of these investments represent \\nsignificant business opportunities, and much of the funding will need to come from private \\ncapit al. Secondly, companies and financial institutions need to better understand and address \\nthe risks of a negative impact on the climate resulting from their business activities, as well as \\nthe risks that climate change poses to their business. Weather -related disasters caused a \\nrecord €283 billion in economic damages in 2017 and could affect up to two -thirds of the \\nEuropean population by 2100 compared with 5% today. Better disclosure of climate related \\ninformation by companies can contribute to the implement ation of the Sendai Framework for \\nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015 -2030, which calls for governments to evaluate, record, share \\nand publically account for disaster losses.  \\nIn March 2018 the Commission published the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, \\nwith the aim of reorienting capital towards sustainable investment, managing financial risks \\nthat arise from climate change and other environmental and social problems, and fostering \\ntransparency and long -termism in financial and economic activity.3 The pu blication of new \\nguidelines on the disclosure of climate -related information by companies is part of the Action \\nPlan.  \\nA number of other actions in the Action Plan depend to some extent on companies disclosing \\nadequate sustainability -related information. T his includes, for example, the proposed \\nregulations on the establishment of a framework (taxonomy) to facilitate sustainable \\ninvestment4, on sustainability disclosures by institutional investors and asset managers5, and \\non carbon -related benchmarks.6 \\n                                                           \\n1 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en   \\n2 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en   \\n3 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0097   \\n4 https://e ur-lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0353   \\n5 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0354   \\n6 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC035 5  ', ' \\n4 \\n Witho ut sufficient, reliable and comparable sustainability -related information from investee \\ncompanies, the financial sector cannot efficiently direct capital to investments that drive \\nsolutions to the sustainability crises we face, and cannot effectively ident ify and manage the \\nrisks to investments that will arise from those crises.  \\nCorporate disclosure of climate related information has improved in recent years. However, \\nthere are still significant gaps, and further improvements in the quantity, quality and \\ncomparability of disclosures are urgently required to meet the needs of investors and other \\nstakeholders.  \\nIn June 2017, the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), established \\nby the G20’s Financial Stability Board, published recommenda tions to encourage financial \\ninstitutions and non -financial companies to disclose information on climate -related risks and \\nopportunities.7 The TCFD recommendations are widely recognised as authoritative guidance \\non the reporting of financially material cli mate -related information, and the Commission \\nencourages companies to implement them. A number of governments and financial regulators \\naround the world have expressed support for the recommendations and are integrating them \\ninto their guidance and policy fr ameworks. Examples include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, \\nJapan, Singapore and South Africa, as well as some EU Member States.  \\nThis supplement integrates the TCFD recommendations, and provides guidance to companies \\nthat is consistent with the Non -Financial  Reporting Directive and the recommendations of the \\nTCFD.  \\nThe Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, appointed by the Commission in June \\n2018, provided recommendations on climate -related disclosures and these guidelines are built \\non those recommen dations. These guidelines take account of stakeholder feedback on the \\nrecommendations of the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, and of the results of \\na targeted online consultation carried out by the services of the European Commission in \\nFebru ary-March 2019.8  \\n1.2      Benefits for reporting companies  \\nBetter disclosure of climate -related information can have benefits for the reporting company \\nitself, such as:  \\n\\uf0b7 increased awareness and understanding of climate -related risks and opportunities \\nwithi n the company, better risk management, and more informed decision -making and \\nstrategic planning;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 a more diverse investor base and a potentially lower cost of capital, resulting for \\nexample from inclusion in actively managed investment portfolios and in \\nsustainability -focused indices, and from improved credit ratings for bond issuance and \\nbetter credit worthiness assessments for bank loans;  \\n \\n                                                           \\n7 https://www.fsb -tcfd.org/   \\n8 https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/finance -2019 -non-financial -reporting -guidelines_en   ', ' \\n5 \\n \\uf0b7 more constructive dialogue with stakeholders, in particular investors and \\nshareholders;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 better corporate reputation and maintenance of social licence to operate.  \\n2      How to use these guidelines  \\n2.1     General considerations  \\nCompanies should read this supplement together with the relevant national legislation \\ntransposing the Non -Financial Reporting Directi ve (2014/95/EU), and if necessary the text of \\nthe Directive itself.  \\nThey should also consider the Non -Binding Guidelines on Non -Financial Reporting \\npublished by the Commission in June 20179, which contain 6 key principles for good non -\\nfinancial reporting, namely that disclosed information should be: (1) material; (2) fair, \\nbalanced and understandable; (3) comprehensive but concise; (4) strategic and forward -\\nlooking10; (5) stakeholder oriented; and (6) consistent and coherent. Those principles and the \\nother s ections of the Non -Binding Guidelines all apply as appropriate to this supplement.  \\nCompanies are also encouraged to read the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -\\nrelated Financial Disclosures, and if relevant the supplementary guidance for the fin ancial \\nsector and for companies operating in the sectors of energy, transport, material and buildings, \\nand agriculture, food and forest products.11 \\nLike the general guidelines published in 2017, this supplement on climate -related reporting is \\nnon-binding. C ompanies may chose alternative approaches to the reporting of climate -related \\ninformation, provided they meet legal requirements.  \\nThese guidelines recognise that the content of climate -related disclosures may vary between \\ncompanies according to a number o f factors, including the sector of activity, geographical \\nlocation and the nature and scale of climate -related risks and opportunities.  \\nMethodologies and best practice in the field of climate -related reporting are evolving fast. \\nThese guidelines therefore recognise that a flexible approach is necessary. Companies and \\nother organisations are strongly encouraged to continue to innovate and further improve \\nclimate -related reporting beyond the content of these guidelines. Companies should also \\nensure that their  approach to climate related reporting is regularly updated in line with the \\nlatest scientific evidence.  \\n                                                           \\n9   https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52017XC0705(01)   \\n10 This does not prevent appropriate consideration of commercially -sensitive information. Relevant information \\nmay be provided in broader terms that still convey useful information to investors and other stakeholders and \\nmeets the overall transparency objective.  \\n11 https://www.fsb -tcfd.org/wp -content/uploads/2017/12/FINA L-TCFD -Annex -Amended -121517.pdf      ', ' \\n6 \\n It is not the intention of these guidelines to encourage stand -alone climate reporting. \\nCompanies are encouraged to integrate climate -related informat ion with other financial and \\nnon-financial information as appropriate in their reports.  \\nThe default location for the non -financial statement according to the Non -Financial Reporting \\nDirective is the company’s management report, although many Member States  have taken up \\nthe option of allowing companies to publish their non -financial statement in a separate report. \\nThe TCFD proposes that its recommended disclosures should be included in the company’s \\nmainstream “annual financial filings”.12  \\nCompanies should in any case seek to ensure that climate -related information is easily \\naccessible for intended users.  If companies make cross -references to other reports or \\ndocuments, this should be done in a simple and user -friendly way, for instance, by applying a \\npracti cal rule of “maximum one ‘click’ out of the report”.    \\nThese guidelines are intended for use by companies that fall under the scope of the Non -\\nFinancial Reporting Directive.13 However, they may also be useful for other companies that \\nwish to disclose clima te-related information.  \\n2.2     Materiality  \\nAccording to the Non -Financial Reporting Directive, a company is required to disclose \\ninformation on environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, and \\nbribery and corruption, to the extent  that such information is necessary for an understanding \\nof the company’s development, performance, position and impact of its activities.14 Climate -\\nrelated information can be considered to fall into the category of environmental matters.  \\nAs indicated in th e Commission’s 2017 Non -Binding Guidelines on Non -Financial \\nReporting, the reference to the “impact of [the company’s] activities” introduced a new \\nelement to be taken into account when assessing the materiality of non -financial information. \\nIn effect, the  Non-Financial Reporting Directive has a double materiality perspective:  \\n- The reference to the company’s “development, performance [and] position” \\nindicates financial materiality, in the broad sense of affecting the value of the \\ncompany. Climate -related in formation should be reported if it is necessary for an \\nunderstanding of the development, performance and position of the company. This \\nperspective is typically of most interest to investors.  \\n \\n- The reference to “impact of [the company’s] activities” indicate s environmental and \\nsocial materiality. Climate -related information should be reported if it is necessary \\nfor an understanding of the external impacts of the company. This perspective is \\n                                                           \\n12 See  Annex  II  “Mapping of Non -Financial  Reporting Directive  Requirements  and  TCFD Recommended \\nDisclosures”  \\n13 Large public interest entities according to Directive 2013/34/EU with more than 500 employees.  \\n14 Article 19a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU (introduced by Directive 2014/95/EU, the Non -Financial Reporting \\nDirective).  ', ' \\n7 \\n \\ntypically of most interest to citizens, consumers, employees, busines s partners, \\ncommunities and civil society organisations. However, an increasing number of \\ninvestors also need to know about the climate impacts of investee companies in \\norder to better understand and measure the climate impacts of their investment \\nportfoli os.  \\nCompanies should consider using the proposed disclosures in these guidelines if they decide \\nthat climate is a material issue from either of these two perspectives.  \\nThese two risk perspectives already overlap in some cases and are increasingly likely to do so \\nin the future. As markets and public policies evolve in response to climate change, the \\npositive and/or negative impacts of a company on the climate will increasingly translate into \\nbusiness opportunities and/or risks that are financially material . \\nThe materiality perspective of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive covers both financial \\nmateriality and environmental and social materiality, whereas the TCFD has a financial \\nmateriality perspective only.  \\n \\nFigure 1  \\nThe double materiality perspective of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive  \\nin the context of reporting climate -related information  \\n ', ' \\n8 \\n When assessing the materiality of climate -related information, companies should consider a \\nlonger -term time horizon than is traditionally the case for financial information. Companies \\nare advised not to prematurely conclude that climate is not a material issue just because some \\nclimate -related risks are perceived to be long -term in nature.  \\nWhen assessing the materiality of climate -related information, co mpanies should consider \\ntheir whole value chain, both upstream in the supply -chain and downstream.  \\nGiven the systemic and pervasive impacts of climate change, most companies under the \\nscope of the Directive are likely to conclude that climate is a material  issue. Companies that \\nconclude that climate is not a material issue are advised to consider making a statement to \\nthat effect, explaining how that conclusion has been reached.  \\n \\n2.3     Climate -related risks, dependencies, and opportunities  \\nClimate -relate d risks  \\nUnder the Non -Financial Reporting Directive, climate -related information should, to the \\nextent necessary, include both the principal risks to the development, performance and \\nposition of the company resulting from climate change, and the principal  risks of a negative \\nimpact on the climate resulting from the company’s activities. The proposed disclosures in \\nthese guidelines reflect both these risk perspectives.  \\nUnless otherwise stated in the text, references to risks should be understood to refer b oth to \\nrisks of negative impacts on the company (transition risks and physical risks – see below) and \\nto risks of negative impacts on the climate.  \\nBoth of these kinds of risk – risks of negative impacts on the company and risks of negative \\nimpacts on the climate – may arise from the companies own operations and may occur \\nthroughout the value chain, both upstream in the supply -chain and downstream.  \\n1) Risks of negative impacts on the climate  \\n \\nSome examples of risks of negative impacts on the climate are:  \\n\\uf0b7 A com pany’s industrial production facility might directly emit greenhouse gases \\n(GHGs) into the atmosphere.  \\n\\uf0b7 The energy that a company buys to run its operations might have been produced from \\nfossil fuels.  \\n\\uf0b7 The product that a company makes might require the cons umption of fossil fuels, for \\nexample in the case of cars that run on petrol or diesel.  \\n\\uf0b7 The production of materials used by the company might result in GHG emissions \\nupstream in their value chain. This may be the case for companies that use materials \\nsuch a s cement or aluminium in their production processes. Similarly, a company \\nproducing or processing forest or agricultural commodities, including in sectors such \\nas food, apparel, or wood processing industries, could potentially be causing, directly \\nor indir ectly, land use change including deforestation and forest degradation and \\nrelated GHG emissions.  ', ' \\n9 \\n  \\n2) Risk of negative impact on the company  \\nThe risks of climate change for the financial performance of the company can be classified as \\nphysical risks or transition risks.15  \\nTransition risks  are risks to the company that arise from the transition to a low -carbon and \\nclimate -resilient economy. They include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Policy risks, for example as a result of energy efficiency requirements, carbon -pricing \\nmechanisms which increase the price of fossil fuels, or policies to encourage \\nsustainable land use.  \\n\\uf0b7 Legal risks, for example the risk of litigation for failing to avoi d or minimise adverse \\nimpacts on the climate, or failing to adapt to climate change.  \\n\\uf0b7 Technology risks, for example if a technology with a less damaging impact on the \\nclimate replaces a technology that is more damaging to the climate.  \\n\\uf0b7 Market risks, for exa mple if the choices of consumers and business customers shift \\ntowards products and services that are less damaging to the climate.   \\n\\uf0b7 Reputational risks, for example the difficulty of attracting and retaining customers, \\nemployees, business partners and inve stors if a company has reputation for damaging \\nthe climate.  \\nGenerally speaking, a company with a higher negative impact on the climate will be more \\nexposed to transition risks.  \\nPhysical risks  are risks to the company that arise from the physical effects of climate \\nchange.16 They include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Acute physical risks, which arise from particular events, especially weather -related \\nevents such as storms, floods, fires or heatwaves, that may damage production \\nfacilities and disrupt value chains.  \\n\\uf0b7 Chronic physical risk s, which arise from longer -term changes in the climate, such as \\ntemperature changes, rising sea levels, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss \\nand changes in land and soil productivity.  \\nThe exposure of a company to physical risks does not directly d epend on whether or not that \\ncompany has a negative impact on the climate.  \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n15 This description of transition and physi cal risks is to a large extent based on the report of the Task Force on \\nClimate -related Financial Disclosures.  \\n16 Further guidance on reporting physical risks can be found in Advancing TCFD Guidance on Physical Climate \\nRisks and Opportunities , EBRD and Glo bal Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation  \\n   https://www.physicalclimaterisk.com/media/EBRD -GCECA_draft_final_report_full.pdf   ', ' \\n10 \\n Dependencies on natural, human and social capitals  \\nMany companies are dependent on natural capital .17 If the natural capital itself is threatened \\nby climate change then the compan y will be exposed to climate -related risks, especially \\nphysical risks. Companies should therefore carefully consider their natural capital \\ndependencies when identifying and reporting on their climate -related risks. For example, an \\nagricultural production c ompany may be dependent on various natural capitals such as water, \\nbiodiversity, and land and soil productivity, all of which are vulnerable to climate change. \\nSuch a company would be expected to explain these dependencies when reporting on its \\nclimate -related risks.  \\nMany companies are also dependent on human and social capital , such as the skills and \\nmotivation of employees, and the level of trust the company enjoys amongst external \\nstakeholders. Companies should integrate information on human and social c apital as \\nappropriate in their reporting on climate -related issues. For example, employees may be \\ncritical to the development of innovative low -carbon products and services.  \\nClimate -related opportunities  \\nClimate -related risks can often be converted into o pportunities by companies offering \\nproducts and services that contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation.  \\nClimate change adaptation means anticipating the adverse effects of climate change and \\ntaking appropriate action to prevent or minimise th e damage they can cause. It includes \\nbusiness opportunities such as new technologies to use scarce water resources more \\nefficiently, or the building of new flood defences.  \\nClimate change mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent GHG emissions. Exa mples of \\nbusiness opportunities associated with mitigation include renewable energy or the \\ndevelopment of more energy efficient buildings and transport systems.  \\nThe taxonomy of sustainable economic activities, proposed by the Commission as part of the \\nAction Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, aims to identify and classify climate -related \\nopportunities.  \\nFigure 2 shows the relationship between climate -related risks and opportunities.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n17 Further explanation and g uidance regarding natural capital is available from the Natural Capital Coalition \\nhttps://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/   ', ' \\n11 \\n \\nFigure 2  \\nClimate -related risks and opportunities  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nClimate -related risks and opportunities throughout the value chain  \\n  \\nWhen reporting on their climate -related risks, dependencies and opportunities, companies \\nshould, where relevant and proportionate, consider their whole value chain, both upstream \\nand down stream. For companies involved in manufacturing activities this means following a \\nproduct life cycle approach that takes account of climate issues in the supply chain and the \\nsourcing of raw material, as well as during the use of the product and when the p roduct \\nreaches end -of-life. Companies providing services, including financial services, will also \\nneed to consider the climate impacts of the activities that they support or facilitate.  \\nWhen SMEs are part of the value chain, companies are encouraged to sup port them in \\nproviding the required information.  \\n2.4     Structure of the proposed disclosures  \\nThese guidelines propose climate -related disclosures for each of the five reporting areas listed \\nin the Non -Financial Reporting Directive: (a) business model (b)  policies and due diligence \\n(c) outcome of policies (d) principal risks and risk management and (e) key performance \\nindicators.  \\nFor each reporting area, the guidelines identify a limited number of recommended \\ndisclosures. A company should consider using th e recommended disclosures to the extent that \\nthey are necessary for an understanding of its development, performance, position and impact \\nof its activities.  ', ' \\n12 \\n Further guidance is provided after the recommended disclosures for each reporting area. The \\nfurthe r guidance consists of suggestions for more detailed information that companies may \\nconsider including as part of the recommended disclosures. In addition, further guidance is \\nprovided for banks and insurance companies in Annex I.  \\nWhen deciding whether and to what extent they use the recommended disclosures and the \\nmore detailed suggestions included under further guidance, including the further guidance for \\nbanks and insurance companies in Annex I, companies should take account of t he principles \\nof good non -financial reporting contained in the Commission’s 2017 Non -Binding Guidelines \\non Non -Financial Reporting, including the principles about disclosed information being: \\nmaterial; fair, balanced and understandable; and comprehensive b ut concise.  \\nThe scale of climate -related risks and opportunities that the company identifies will be an \\nimportant factor in deciding whether and to what extent they use the recommended \\ndisclosures and the further guidance.  \\n2.5     Consistency with recogni sed reporting frameworks and standards  \\nCompanies are encouraged to disclose information in accordance with widely accepted \\nreporting standards and frameworks to maximise comparability for their stakeholders.  To \\ncontribute to convergence at EU and global l evel, these guidelines refer to a number of \\nrecognised reporting frameworks and standards.  \\nIn particular, they incorporate the recommended disclosures of the Task -Force on Climate -\\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which are themselves aligned with oth er principal \\nframeworks. The disclosures recommended by the TCFD are separately identified in these \\nguidelines. Annex II shows the disclosure requirements of the Non -Financial Reporting \\nDirective mapped against the recommended disclosures of the TCFD.    \\nIn addition to the TCFD, these guidelines also take particular account of the standards and \\nframeworks developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the CDP, the Climate \\nDisclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) \\nand the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and of the EU Eco -Management \\nand Audit Scheme (EMAS).18 \\n3       Recommended disclosures and further guidance  \\n3.1      Business Model  \\nIt is very important for stakeholders to understand the company’s view of how climate \\nchange impacts its business model and strategy, and how its activities can affect the climate, \\nover the short, medium and long term. To adequately report on climate relat ed matters, \\ncompanies will need to take a longer term perspective than they normally do for financial \\nreporting.  \\n                                                           \\n18 The Corporate Reporting Dialogue is undertaking work to better align the climate -related disclosures of the \\nIIRC, SASB, GRI, CDP and CDSB. Companies are advised to take account of this work when it is complete.  ', \" \\n13 \\n The climate -related risks and opportunities of a company will depend on the type of its \\nactivity, its geographic locations and its positioning  in the transition to a low -carbon and \\nclimate -resilient economy.  \\nTo appropriately incorporate the potential effects of climate change into their planning \\nprocesses, companies should consider how climate -related risks and opportunities may \\nevolve and thei r potential business implications under different conditions. One way to assess \\nsuch implications is through the use of scenario analysis.  \\nCompanies that do not appropriately consider their business model and strategy in light of \\nclimate change may both ca use negative effects on the climate and experience negative \\nimpacts on their business such as on the profit and loss statement, financing, future regulatory \\nburden, and “licence to operate”.

Banks and insurance companies should look at the recommended \\ndisclosures under Section 3  from the particular perspective of their business activities, \\nincluding lending, investing, insurance underwriting, and asset management activiti es.27 This \\nannex aims to help banks and insurance companies in this exercise, and contains further \\nguidance for them to consider using, where proportionate, when disclosing the information \\nrecommended under Section 3 .  \\nThis annex does not address other fina ncial sector companies, such as asset management \\ncompanies or pension funds, because they do not fall under the scope of the Non -Financial \\nReporting Directive. Such companies may nevertheless find some of the proposed disclosures \\nin this annex useful.  \\nThe Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth places a particular emphasis on the \\nsystemic importance of the financial sector in enabling the transition to a low -carbon and \\nclimate -resilient economy. Unlike most other companies, banks and insurance companies  are \\nboth providers and users of climate -related information. Banks and insurance companies may \\nexacerbate climate -related risks if their investments and insurance underwriting policies \\nsupport economic activities that contribute to climate change via GHG emissions, including \\nfrom deforestation, forest degradation or land use change. Conversely, they can promote the \\ntransition to a low -carbon and climate resilient economy and increase awareness of the \\ntransition by integrating an evaluation of the potential  impact on climate change of their \\nprospective investments, loans, and insurance contracts into their policies and procedures.  \\nWhere appropriate the further guidance set out below makes a distinction between disclosures \\nthat may be relevant to all banks an d insurance companies, and disclosures that would only be \\nrelevant to a particular business activity (lending, investing, insurance underwriting or asset \\nmanagement).  \\n                                                           \\n28 Financial   institutions  should   read   and  use  these  proposed   disclosures  with  due   regard  for  any   legal  \\nrequirements regarding confidentiality.  ', ' \\n28 \\n 1      Business Model  \\nBanks and insurance companies should consider including the follow ing information as part \\nof the recommended disclosures on Business Model under Section 3 : \\n- How climate -related risks and opportunities of the investment, lending and insurance \\nunderwriting portfolios might affect the financial institution’s business model.  \\n- Whether and how the institution takes into consideration that its counterparties take \\nclimate -related risks and opportunities into account.  \\n- How the assessment of climate -related risks and opportunities are factored into \\nrelevant investment, lending and ins urance underwriting strategies and how each \\nstrategy might be affected by the transition to a lower -carbon economy.  \\n- Insurance underwriting activities: how the potential impacts from climate change \\ncould influence policyholder, ceding company, reinsurer and  their selection by the \\ninsurance company.  \\n \\n2      Policies and Due Diligence Processes  \\nBanks and insurance companies should consider including the following information as part \\nof the recommended disclosures on Policies and due diligence processes under Section 3:  \\n- How the financial institution encourages better disclosure and practices related to \\nclimate -related risks to improve data availability and any effort to increase the \\nawareness of counterparties, and more generally of customers, of the relevance o f \\nclimate -related issues as part of their lending, investment, and insurance underwriting \\nprocesses, including for example by means of specialty climate -related risk advisory \\nservices.  \\n- Any stewardship activities related to the financial institution’s clima te strategy such as \\nengagements with companies, outcomes, and proxy voting (e.g. resolutions filed or \\nsupported).  \\n- Any investment, lending and insurance underwriting portfolio contributing to climate \\nchange mitigation and adaptation and any relevant target in this respect, e.g. in terms \\nof insurance revenues related to energy efficiency and low carbon technology.  \\n- Investment activities: how climate -related issues are considered as drivers of value in \\nthe financial institution’s  investment decision process.  \\n- Insurance underwriting activities: whether specific climate -related products are under \\ndevelopment, such as the underwriting of risks of green infrastructure and nature -\\nbased solutions.28 \\n- Insurance underwriting activities: whether any of the company’s life pr oducts \\nincorporate climate considerations in the modelling of biometric risks (Life).  \\n                                                           \\n28 http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index.cfm?pg=nbs   ', ' \\n29 \\n - Insurance underwriting activities: whether the insurance company is part of public -\\nprivate partnerships to promote awareness raising about climate -related risks, disaster  \\nrisk resilience and/or climate adaptation investments.  \\n- Asset management activities: how climate -related considerations are embedded in \\nsuitability assessments in order to understand customers’ preferences and awareness \\nregarding climate -related risks and opportunities.  \\n- Asset management activities: how the financial institution ensures that its climate -\\nrelated performance is aligned with the climate strategy of its clients.  \\n- Asset management activities: the targets associated with climate -related exposure of  \\nassets under management across asset classes (e.g. equity / bonds / infrastructure / real \\nestate / structured products / MBS /derivatives).  \\n3      Outcomes  \\nBanks and insurance companies should consider including the following information as part \\nof the recommended disclosures on Outcomes under Section 3:  \\n- The development trend of the amount of carbon -related assets in the different \\nportfolios against any relev ant target set and the related risks over time.  \\n- The development trend of the weighted average carbon intensity for the different \\nportfolios against any relevant target set and the related risks over time. Financial \\ninstitutions should disclose the changes in the sector and geographic allocation of their \\ninvestments compared to the previous reporting year and explain the impact of these \\nchanges on the average weighted carbon intensity of their portfolios.  \\n4      Risks and Risk management  \\nBanks and insurance companies should consider including the following information as part \\nof the recommended disclosures on Risks and risk management under Section 3 : \\n- Whether risk management processes, including internal stress testing, consider \\nclimate -related risks.  \\n- Any exp osures in the different lending, investment and underwriting activities to \\nsectors perceived as contributing to climate change, which might create reputational \\nrisks for the financial institution.  \\n- The climate related risks identified in the different lendi ng, investment or underwriting \\nactivities and how the financial institution assesses and manages those risks.  \\n- The exposure of financial assets, non -financial assets and assets under management to \\nprincipal climate -related risks and provide with a breakdown  of those risks in physical \\nand transition risks.  \\n- How the financial institution has assessed the exposure of financial assets and non -\\nfinancial assets to climate -related risks under different climate -related scenarios.  ', ' \\n30 \\n - Characterisation of their climate -related risks in the context of traditional industry risk \\ncategories such as credit risk, market risk and operational risk.29 \\n- How climate -related risks could affect overall solvency needs of insurance companies \\nand banks’ present and future regulato ry capital requirements. For that purpose, banks \\nmay use the outcomes of their own internal capital adequacy assessment process (see \\nArticle 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU), and insurance companies may use the results of \\nthe calculations carried -out in their O wn Risk and Solvency Assessments (see Article \\n45 of Directive 2009/138/EC and Article 262 of Commission Delegated Regulation \\n(EU) 2015/35),  and the outcome of stress testing and sensitivity analysis (see Article \\n295.6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU ) 2015/35), in particular when those \\ntechniques make use of  climate related data.30 \\n- Lending activities: volume of the collateral highly exposed to climate -related risks and \\nthe impact of the selected scenarios on its value.  \\n- Lending activities: volume of real estate collateral by energy efficiency rating \\naccording to energy performance certificates. In particular, volume of real estate \\ncollaterals highly exposed to transition risk, including collateral with the lowest \\nenergy efficiency ratings in compariso n to total collaterals.  \\n- Lending activities: volume of real estate collaterals highly exposed to physical risk in \\ncomparison to total collaterals.  \\n- Insurance underwriting activities: processes for identifying and assessing climate -\\nrelated risks on re -/insura nce by geography, business division, or product segments.  \\n- Insurance underwriting activities: mitigating actions, such as reinsurance treaties or \\nhedging strategies put in place by the institution to reduce climate -related risks and the \\neffect of any change  in such techniques.  \\n- Insurance underwriting activities: the amount of carbon -related underwriting \\nexposures in terms of insurance revenues.  \\n                                                           \\n29 Examples of Climate Risks across Insurance Operations and Activities: International Association of Insurance \\nSupervisors 2018 https://www.iaisweb.org/page/supervisory -material/issues -papers/file/76026/sif -iais-issues -\\npaper -on-climate -changes -risk.  \\n30 In light of regulatory developments in the prudential area, banks and insurance companies should ensure \\nconsistency between  the disclosed information required by prudential rules and any other information \\ndisclosed in general purpose reports.  ', ' \\n31 \\n 5      KPIs  \\nIn disclosing indicators related to GHG emissio ns, banks and insurance companies should focus on their Scope 3 GHG emissions, despite the well -\\nknown challenges. Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (direct emissions and indirect emissions from the generation of purchased  energy) are likely \\nto be small whe n compared to other indirect emissions (Scope 3).  \\nWhere relevant and proportionate, the reported Scope 3 GHG emissions of banks and insurance companies should include not only  their \\ncounterparties’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also their counterparties’ Sc ope 3 emissions. When SMEs are part of the value chain, banks and \\ninsurance companies are encouraged to support them in providing the required information.  \\nWhen disclosing key performance indicators relevant to their particular business and in supporting their other qualitative climate -related disclosures, \\nas recommended under Section 3, banks and insurance companies should consider disclosing the following indicators:  \\nKPI Unit of \\nMeasure  Example  Rationale  Alignment with \\nOther Reporting \\nFrameworks  EU Policy \\nReference  \\nAmount or percentage of carbon -related \\nassets in each portfolio in M€ or as a \\npercentage of the current portfolio \\nvalue.31 M in \\nreporting \\ncurrency / \\npercentage  €20 m or 20% carbon -related \\nassets of bank’s equity portfolio  \\n Show awareness of the exposure \\nof portfolio to sectors affected to \\nvarying degrees by climate -\\nrelated risks and opportunities .

The TCFD suggests defining \\ncarbon -related assets as those assets tied to the energy and utilities sectors under the Global Industry Classification Standard, ex cluding water utilities and independent power \\nand renewable electricity producer  industries.  \\n32   Financial institutions should disclose the changes in the sector and geographic allocation of their investments compared to t he previous reporting year and explain the impact of \\nthese changes on the average weighted carbon intensity of the ir portfolios.

', ' \\n36 \\n Annex II: Mapping of Non -Financial Reporting Directive Requirements and TCFD \\nRecommended Disclosures  \\nThe disclosures proposed in this supplement correspond to the requirements of the Non -\\nFinancial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and are a lso designed to integrate the recommended \\ndisclosures of the TCFD.  \\nThe graphic below illustrates how this supplement allocates each of the TCFD recommended \\ndisclosures to a disclosure requirement of the NFRD. This represents one option for cross -\\nreferencin g the TCFD recommended disclosures with the disclosures required by the NFRD. \\nSince the NFRD and TCFD use different terms and concepts, this cross -referencing can be \\ndone in other ways. Companies may wish to consider other options and are encouraged to \\nexperiment further in this regard.  \\nFigure 3  \\nMapping of NFRD Requirements and TCFD Recommended Disclosures  \\n \\n \\nCompanies that are subject to the requirements of the NFRD and that seek to implement the \\nTCFD recommendations may wish to consider the following:  \\nBusiness ModelPolicies and Due \\nDiligence \\nProcessesOutcomesPrincipal Risks \\nand Their \\nManagementKey \\nPerformance \\nIndicators\\na)Board’s oversight x\\nb)Management’s role x\\na)Climate-related risks and \\nopportunitiesx\\nb)Impact of climate-related \\nrisks and opportunities\\nc)Resilience of the \\norganization’s strategy\\na)Processes for identifying \\nand assessingx\\nb)Processes for managing\\nc)Integration into overall \\nrisk management\\na)Metrics used to assess\\nb)GHG emissions\\nc)TargetsNFRD ElementsGovernance Strategy Risk Mgmt. Metrics & TargetsTCFD Recommended \\nDisclosures', ' \\n37 \\n \\uf0b7 The TCFD proposes that its recommended disclosures are published in the company’s \\n“annual financial filings”35. The NFRD allows Member States to permit companies to \\npublish their non -financial statement in a separate report under certain conditions, and a \\nmajo rity of Member States have taken up this option. If a company subject to the NFRD \\nwants to the meet the recommendations of the TCFD regarding the location of its climate -\\nrelated disclosures, it should publish these disclosures in its management report.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The materiality perspective of the NFRD covers both financial materiality and \\nenvironmental and social materiality, whereas the TCFD has a financial materiality \\nperspective only. In principle therefore, information considered material from the \\nperspective o f the TCFD should also be material from the perspective of the NFRD.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The TCFD states that its recommended disclosures related to Strategy and to Metrics and \\nTargets should be subject to a financial materiality assessment. The TCFD does not, \\nhowever, stat e that a materiality assessment should apply to its recommended disclosures \\non Governance and Risk Management, implicitly proposing that its disclosures on \\nGovernance and Risk Management should be made irrespective of materiality. Therefore, \\na company want ing to implement the TCFD recommendations may need to disclose \\ncertain information even if that information is not required according to the NFRD.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n35 Implementing  the  Recommendations  of  the  TCFD -  Appendix 2  Glossary:  Financial Filings refer to the \\nannual reporting packages in which organisations are required to deliver their audited financial results under \\nthe corporate, compliance, or secu rities laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate.

       " '3 1 Introduction 1.1 Why provide new guidelines on climate -related disclosures? The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (October 2018) all call for accelerated and decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to create a low -carbon and climate -resilient economy. The EU has agreed ambitious targets for 2030 regarding GHG emission reductions, renewable energy and energy efficiency1, and has approved rules on GHG emissions from land use as well as emissions targets for cars and vans. In 2018 the Commission published its strategic long -term vision for a prosperous, modern , competitive and climate -neutral economy by 2050.2 Companies and financial institutions have a critical role to play in the transition to a low - carbon and climate -resilient economy. Firstly, an additional annual investment of €180 billion is already neede d to meet the EU’s energy and climate 2030 targets, and further funds will be needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Many of these investments represent significant business opportunities, and much of the funding will need to come from private capit al. Secondly, companies and financial institutions need to better understand and address the risks of a negative impact on the climate resulting from their business activities, as well as the risks that climate change poses to their business. Weather -related disasters caused a record €283 billion in economic damages in 2017 and could affect up to two -thirds of the European population by 2100 compared with 5% today. Better disclosure of climate related information by companies can contribute to the implement ation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 -2030, which calls for governments to evaluate, record, share and publically account for disaster losses. In March 2018 the Commission published the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, with the aim of reorienting capital towards sustainable investment, managing financial risks that arise from climate change and other environmental and social problems, and fostering transparency and long -termism in financial and economic activity.3 The pu blication of new guidelines on the disclosure of climate -related information by companies is part of the Action Plan. A number of other actions in the Action Plan depend to some extent on companies disclosing adequate sustainability -related information. T his includes, for example, the proposed regulations on the establishment of a framework (taxonomy) to facilitate sustainable investment4, on sustainability disclosures by institutional investors and asset managers5, and on carbon -related benchmarks.6 1 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en 2 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en 3 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0097 4 https://e ur-lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0353 5 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC0354 6 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018PC035 5',\n",
       " '4 Witho ut sufficient, reliable and comparable sustainability -related information from investee companies, the financial sector cannot efficiently direct capital to investments that drive solutions to the sustainability crises we face, and cannot effectively ident ify and manage the risks to investments that will arise from those crises. Corporate disclosure of climate related information has improved in recent years. However, there are still significant gaps, and further improvements in the quantity, quality and comparability of disclosures are urgently required to meet the needs of investors and other stakeholders. In June 2017, the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), established by the G20’s Financial Stability Board, published recommenda tions to encourage financial institutions and non -financial companies to disclose information on climate -related risks and opportunities.7 The TCFD recommendations are widely recognised as authoritative guidance on the reporting of financially material cli mate -related information, and the Commission encourages companies to implement them. A number of governments and financial regulators around the world have expressed support for the recommendations and are integrating them into their guidance and policy fr ameworks. Examples include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Africa, as well as some EU Member States. This supplement integrates the TCFD recommendations, and provides guidance to companies that is consistent with the Non -Financial Reporting Directive and the recommendations of the TCFD. The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, appointed by the Commission in June 2018, provided recommendations on climate -related disclosures and these guidelines are built on those recommen dations. These guidelines take account of stakeholder feedback on the recommendations of the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, and of the results of a targeted online consultation carried out by the services of the European Commission in Febru ary-March 2019.8 1.2 Benefits for reporting companies Better disclosure of climate -related information can have benefits for the reporting company itself, such as: \\uf0b7 increased awareness and understanding of climate -related risks and opportunities withi n the company, better risk management, and more informed decision -making and strategic planning; \\uf0b7 a more diverse investor base and a potentially lower cost of capital, resulting for example from inclusion in actively managed investment portfolios and in sustainability -focused indices, and from improved credit ratings for bond issuance and better credit worthiness assessments for bank loans; 7 https://www.fsb -tcfd.org/ 8 https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/finance -2019 -non-financial -reporting -guidelines_en',\n",
       " '5 \\uf0b7 more constructive dialogue with stakeholders, in particular investors and shareholders; \\uf0b7 better corporate reputation and maintenance of social licence to operate. 2 How to use these guidelines 2.1 General considerations Companies should read this supplement together with the relevant national legislation transposing the Non -Financial Reporting Directi ve (2014/95/EU), and if necessary the text of the Directive itself. They should also consider the Non -Binding Guidelines on Non -Financial Reporting published by the Commission in June 20179, which contain 6 key principles for good non - financial reporting, namely that disclosed information should be: (1) material; (2) fair, balanced and understandable; (3) comprehensive but concise; (4) strategic and forward - looking10; (5) stakeholder oriented; and (6) consistent and coherent. Those principles and the other s ections of the Non -Binding Guidelines all apply as appropriate to this supplement. Companies are also encouraged to read the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate - related Financial Disclosures, and if relevant the supplementary guidance for the fin ancial sector and for companies operating in the sectors of energy, transport, material and buildings, and agriculture, food and forest products.11 Like the general guidelines published in 2017, this supplement on climate -related reporting is non-binding. C ompanies may chose alternative approaches to the reporting of climate -related information, provided they meet legal requirements. These guidelines recognise that the content of climate -related disclosures may vary between companies according to a number o f factors, including the sector of activity, geographical location and the nature and scale of climate -related risks and opportunities. Methodologies and best practice in the field of climate -related reporting are evolving fast. These guidelines therefore recognise that a flexible approach is necessary. Companies and other organisations are strongly encouraged to continue to innovate and further improve climate -related reporting beyond the content of these guidelines. Companies should also ensure that their approach to climate related reporting is regularly updated in line with the latest scientific evidence. 9 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52017XC0705(01) 10 This does not prevent appropriate consideration of commercially -sensitive information. Relevant information may be provided in broader terms that still convey useful information to investors and other stakeholders and meets the overall transparency objective. 11 https://www.fsb -tcfd.org/wp -content/uploads/2017/12/FINA L-TCFD -Annex -Amended -121517.pdf',\n",
       " '6 It is not the intention of these guidelines to encourage stand -alone climate reporting. Companies are encouraged to integrate climate -related informat ion with other financial and non-financial information as appropriate in their reports. The default location for the non -financial statement according to the Non -Financial Reporting Directive is the company’s management report, although many Member States have taken up the option of allowing companies to publish their non -financial statement in a separate report. The TCFD proposes that its recommended disclosures should be included in the company’s mainstream “annual financial filings”.12 Companies should in any case seek to ensure that climate -related information is easily accessible for intended users. If companies make cross -references to other reports or documents, this should be done in a simple and user -friendly way, for instance, by applying a practi cal rule of “maximum one ‘click’ out of the report”. These guidelines are intended for use by companies that fall under the scope of the Non - Financial Reporting Directive.13 However, they may also be useful for other companies that wish to disclose clima te-related information. 2.2 Materiality According to the Non -Financial Reporting Directive, a company is required to disclose information on environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, and bribery and corruption, to the extent that such information is necessary for an understanding of the company’s development, performance, position and impact of its activities.14 Climate - related information can be considered to fall into the category of environmental matters. As indicated in th e Commission’s 2017 Non -Binding Guidelines on Non -Financial Reporting, the reference to the “impact of [the company’s] activities” introduced a new element to be taken into account when assessing the materiality of non -financial information. In effect, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive has a double materiality perspective: - The reference to the company’s “development, performance [and] position” indicates financial materiality, in the broad sense of affecting the value of the company. Climate -related in formation should be reported if it is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance and position of the company. This perspective is typically of most interest to investors. - The reference to “impact of [the company’s] activities” indicate s environmental and social materiality. Climate -related information should be reported if it is necessary for an understanding of the external impacts of the company. This perspective is 12 See Annex II “Mapping of Non -Financial Reporting Directive Requirements and TCFD Recommended Disclosures” 13 Large public interest entities according to Directive 2013/34/EU with more than 500 employees. 14 Article 19a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU (introduced by Directive 2014/95/EU, the Non -Financial Reporting Directive).',\n",
       " '7 typically of most interest to citizens, consumers, employees, busines s partners, communities and civil society organisations. However, an increasing number of investors also need to know about the climate impacts of investee companies in order to better understand and measure the climate impacts of their investment portfoli os. Companies should consider using the proposed disclosures in these guidelines if they decide that climate is a material issue from either of these two perspectives. These two risk perspectives already overlap in some cases and are increasingly likely to do so in the future. As markets and public policies evolve in response to climate change, the positive and/or negative impacts of a company on the climate will increasingly translate into business opportunities and/or risks that are financially material . The materiality perspective of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive covers both financial materiality and environmental and social materiality, whereas the TCFD has a financial materiality perspective only. Figure 1 The double materiality perspective of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive in the context of reporting climate -related information',\n",
       " '8 When assessing the materiality of climate -related information, companies should consider a longer -term time horizon than is traditionally the case for financial information. Companies are advised not to prematurely conclude that climate is not a material issue just because some climate -related risks are perceived to be long -term in nature. When assessing the materiality of climate -related information, co mpanies should consider their whole value chain, both upstream in the supply -chain and downstream. Given the systemic and pervasive impacts of climate change, most companies under the scope of the Directive are likely to conclude that climate is a material issue. Companies that conclude that climate is not a material issue are advised to consider making a statement to that effect, explaining how that conclusion has been reached. 2.3 Climate -related risks, dependencies, and opportunities Climate -relate d risks Under the Non -Financial Reporting Directive, climate -related information should, to the extent necessary, include both the principal risks to the development, performance and position of the company resulting from climate change, and the principal risks of a negative impact on the climate resulting from the company’s activities. The proposed disclosures in these guidelines reflect both these risk perspectives. Unless otherwise stated in the text, references to risks should be understood to refer b oth to risks of negative impacts on the company (transition risks and physical risks – see below) and to risks of negative impacts on the climate. Both of these kinds of risk – risks of negative impacts on the company and risks of negative impacts on the climate – may arise from the companies own operations and may occur throughout the value chain, both upstream in the supply -chain and downstream. 1) Risks of negative impacts on the climate Some examples of risks of negative impacts on the climate are: \\uf0b7 A com pany’s industrial production facility might directly emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. \\uf0b7 The energy that a company buys to run its operations might have been produced from fossil fuels. \\uf0b7 The product that a company makes might require the cons umption of fossil fuels, for example in the case of cars that run on petrol or diesel. \\uf0b7 The production of materials used by the company might result in GHG emissions upstream in their value chain. This may be the case for companies that use materials such a s cement or aluminium in their production processes. Similarly, a company producing or processing forest or agricultural commodities, including in sectors such as food, apparel, or wood processing industries, could potentially be causing, directly or indir ectly, land use change including deforestation and forest degradation and related GHG emissions.',\n",
       " '9 2) Risk of negative impact on the company The risks of climate change for the financial performance of the company can be classified as physical risks or transition risks.15 Transition risks are risks to the company that arise from the transition to a low -carbon and climate -resilient economy. They include: \\uf0b7 Policy risks, for example as a result of energy efficiency requirements, carbon -pricing mechanisms which increase the price of fossil fuels, or policies to encourage sustainable land use. \\uf0b7 Legal risks, for example the risk of litigation for failing to avoi d or minimise adverse impacts on the climate, or failing to adapt to climate change. \\uf0b7 Technology risks, for example if a technology with a less damaging impact on the climate replaces a technology that is more damaging to the climate. \\uf0b7 Market risks, for exa mple if the choices of consumers and business customers shift towards products and services that are less damaging to the climate. \\uf0b7 Reputational risks, for example the difficulty of attracting and retaining customers, employees, business partners and inve stors if a company has reputation for damaging the climate. Generally speaking, a company with a higher negative impact on the climate will be more exposed to transition risks. Physical risks are risks to the company that arise from the physical effects of climate change.16 They include: \\uf0b7 Acute physical risks, which arise from particular events, especially weather -related events such as storms, floods, fires or heatwaves, that may damage production facilities and disrupt value chains. \\uf0b7 Chronic physical risk s, which arise from longer -term changes in the climate, such as temperature changes, rising sea levels, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss and changes in land and soil productivity. The exposure of a company to physical risks does not directly d epend on whether or not that company has a negative impact on the climate. 15 This description of transition and physi cal risks is to a large extent based on the report of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures. 16 Further guidance on reporting physical risks can be found in Advancing TCFD Guidance on Physical Climate Risks and Opportunities , EBRD and Glo bal Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation https://www.physicalclimaterisk.com/media/EBRD -GCECA_draft_final_report_full.pdf',\n",
       " '10 Dependencies on natural, human and social capitals Many companies are dependent on natural capital .17 If the natural capital itself is threatened by climate change then the compan y will be exposed to climate -related risks, especially physical risks. Companies should therefore carefully consider their natural capital dependencies when identifying and reporting on their climate -related risks. For example, an agricultural production c ompany may be dependent on various natural capitals such as water, biodiversity, and land and soil productivity, all of which are vulnerable to climate change. Such a company would be expected to explain these dependencies when reporting on its climate -related risks. Many companies are also dependent on human and social capital , such as the skills and motivation of employees, and the level of trust the company enjoys amongst external stakeholders. Companies should integrate information on human and social c apital as appropriate in their reporting on climate -related issues. For example, employees may be critical to the development of innovative low -carbon products and services. Climate -related opportunities Climate -related risks can often be converted into o pportunities by companies offering products and services that contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. Climate change adaptation means anticipating the adverse effects of climate change and taking appropriate action to prevent or minimise th e damage they can cause. It includes business opportunities such as new technologies to use scarce water resources more efficiently, or the building of new flood defences. Climate change mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent GHG emissions. Exa mples of business opportunities associated with mitigation include renewable energy or the development of more energy efficient buildings and transport systems. The taxonomy of sustainable economic activities, proposed by the Commission as part of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, aims to identify and classify climate -related opportunities. Figure 2 shows the relationship between climate -related risks and opportunities. 17 Further explanation and g uidance regarding natural capital is available from the Natural Capital Coalition https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/',\n",
       " '11 Figure 2 Climate -related risks and opportunities Climate -related risks and opportunities throughout the value chain When reporting on their climate -related risks, dependencies and opportunities, companies should, where relevant and proportionate, consider their whole value chain, both upstream and down stream. For companies involved in manufacturing activities this means following a product life cycle approach that takes account of climate issues in the supply chain and the sourcing of raw material, as well as during the use of the product and when the p roduct reaches end -of-life. Companies providing services, including financial services, will also need to consider the climate impacts of the activities that they support or facilitate. When SMEs are part of the value chain, companies are encouraged to sup port them in providing the required information. 2.4 Structure of the proposed disclosures These guidelines propose climate -related disclosures for each of the five reporting areas listed in the Non -Financial Reporting Directive: (a) business model (b) policies and due diligence (c) outcome of policies (d) principal risks and risk management and (e) key performance indicators. For each reporting area, the guidelines identify a limited number of recommended disclosures. A company should consider using th e recommended disclosures to the extent that they are necessary for an understanding of its development, performance, position and impact of its activities.',\n",
       " '12 Further guidance is provided after the recommended disclosures for each reporting area. The furthe r guidance consists of suggestions for more detailed information that companies may consider including as part of the recommended disclosures. In addition, further guidance is provided for banks and insurance companies in Annex I. When deciding whether and to what extent they use the recommended disclosures and the more detailed suggestions included under further guidance, including the further guidance for banks and insurance companies in Annex I, companies should take account of t he principles of good non -financial reporting contained in the Commission’s 2017 Non -Binding Guidelines on Non -Financial Reporting, including the principles about disclosed information being: material; fair, balanced and understandable; and comprehensive b ut concise. The scale of climate -related risks and opportunities that the company identifies will be an important factor in deciding whether and to what extent they use the recommended disclosures and the further guidance. 2.5 Consistency with recogni sed reporting frameworks and standards Companies are encouraged to disclose information in accordance with widely accepted reporting standards and frameworks to maximise comparability for their stakeholders. To contribute to convergence at EU and global l evel, these guidelines refer to a number of recognised reporting frameworks and standards. In particular, they incorporate the recommended disclosures of the Task -Force on Climate - related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which are themselves aligned with oth er principal frameworks. The disclosures recommended by the TCFD are separately identified in these guidelines. Annex II shows the disclosure requirements of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive mapped against the recommended disclosures of the TCFD. In addition to the TCFD, these guidelines also take particular account of the standards and frameworks developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the CDP, the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and of the EU Eco -Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).18 3 Recommended disclosures and further guidance 3.1 Business Model It is very important for stakeholders to understand the company’s view of how climate change impacts its business model and strategy, and how its activities can affect the climate, over the short, medium and long term. To adequately report on climate relat ed matters, companies will need to take a longer term perspective than they normally do for financial reporting. 18 The Corporate Reporting Dialogue is undertaking work to better align the climate -related disclosures of the IIRC, SASB, GRI, CDP and CDSB. Companies are advised to take account of this work when it is complete.',\n",
       " \"13 The climate -related risks and opportunities of a company will depend on the type of its activity, its geographic locations and its positioning in the transition to a low -carbon and climate -resilient economy. To appropriately incorporate the potential effects of climate change into their planning processes, companies should consider how climate -related risks and opportunities may evolve and thei r potential business implications under different conditions. One way to assess such implications is through the use of scenario analysis. Companies that do not appropriately consider their business model and strategy in light of climate change may both ca use negative effects on the climate and experience negative impacts on their business such as on the profit and loss statement, financing, future regulatory burden, and “licence to operate”. On the other hand, identifying new climate -related opportunities may strengthen the business model and earnings outlook of a company.

[Covers TCFD recommendation Strategy b)] Describe the ways in which the company’s business model can impact the climate, both positively and negatively.

Information on the involvement of the board and management, in particular their respective responsibilities in relati on to climate change, informs stakeholders on the level of the company’s awareness of climate -related issues. When describing the role of the board, the company may wish to make a reference to any corporate governance statement that it is required to publi sh. Stakeholders may also be interested in the company’s policies and any associated targets that demonstrate its commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and in its due diligence processes. This will help stakeholders to understand the c ompany’s ability to manage its business to minimise climate -related risk, limit negative impacts on the climate and maximise positive impacts throughout the value chain. Policies and processes addressing climate -related topics may be separate from or integ rated into other policies and operational processes. Due diligence processes that take climate into account, for example, might be integrated into the company’s risk management framework. The company may want to explain its approach to managing climate -related issues and the rationale for choosing that approach. Table 2 - Disclosure on Policies and Due Diligence Processes Describe any company policies related to climate, including any climate change mitigation or adaptation policy. Describe any climate -related targets the company has set as part of its policies, especially any GHG emissions targets, and how company targets relate to national and international targets and to the Paris Agreement in particular.',\n",

In assessing its performance through target setting and reporting against the targets, the company demonstrates the consisten cy of its strategy, actions, and decisions related to climate change. Quantitative aspects, such as indicators supporting the analyses, are covered in Section 3.5 Key Performance Indicators of these guidelines.

Further guidance: \\uf0b7 Describe how the performance of the company with regard to climate influences its financial performance, where possible with reference to financial KPIs. 3.4 Principal Risks and their Management It is very important for investors and other interested stakeholders to know how the company identifies climate -related risks, the principal risks it has identified, and how it manages those risks. Disclosures on risks should include risks of the company having a negative impact on the climate and risks of climate change having a negative impact on the the company ( transition and physical risks), and whether and how t he two are linked. Companies are advised to take account of the risk definitions given in Section 2.3 when deciding what information to disclose regarding risks. When disclosing information about climate -related risks, companies should consider longer - term time horizons than they traditionally use for financial risks. Gaps in data and methodologies may in some cases make it difficult to present quantitative information about climate -related risks, especially regarding longer time horizons. In such cases, companies are encouraged to present qualitative information until these data and methodological issues are adequately addressed.

They should consider using',\n",
       " '18 indicators to support their other climate -related disclosures, such as those related to outcomes or principal risks and thei r management, and to allow for aggregation and comparability across companies and jurisdictions. Indicators should be integrated with other disclosures to support and explain the narrative. However, it is also considered good practice to publish an additio nal table that presents all indicators in one place. To meet the expectations of the TCFD, companies should disclose indicators and targets used by the company to assess climate related risks and opportunities in line with their strategy and risk managemen t processes [Covers TCFD recommendation Metrics and targets a)] .

       " '27 Annex I: Further guidance for banks and insurance companies The requirements of the Non -Financial Rep orting Directive apply to large listed companies, banks, and insurance companies. The Directive imposes the same requirements on all companies under its scope, regardless of the sector in which they operate. It therefore does not impose additional require ments on banks and insurance companies compared to other companies. The proposed disclosures in Section 3 are for all companies that fall under the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, regardless of their sector of activity, including banks and insurance companies. Banks and insurance companies should look at the recommended disclosures under Section 3 from the particular perspective of their business activities, including lending, investing, insurance underwriting, and asset management activiti es.27 This annex aims to help banks and insurance companies in this exercise, and contains further guidance for them to consider using, where proportionate, when disclosing the information recommended under Section 3 . This annex does not address other fina ncial sector companies, such as asset management companies or pension funds, because they do not fall under the scope of the Non -Financial Reporting Directive. Such companies may nevertheless find some of the proposed disclosures in this annex useful. The Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth places a particular emphasis on the systemic importance of the financial sector in enabling the transition to a low -carbon and climate -resilient economy. Unlike most other companies, banks and insurance companies are both providers and users of climate -related information. Banks and insurance companies may exacerbate climate -related risks if their investments and insurance underwriting policies support economic activities that contribute to climate change via GHG emissions, including from deforestation, forest degradation or land use change. Conversely, they can promote the transition to a low -carbon and climate resilient economy and increase awareness of the transition by integrating an evaluation of the potential impact on climate change of their prospective investments, loans, and insurance contracts into their policies and procedures. Where appropriate the further guidance set out below makes a distinction between disclosures that may be relevant to all banks an d insurance companies, and disclosures that would only be relevant to a particular business activity (lending, investing, insurance underwriting or asset management). 28 Financial institutions should read and use these proposed disclosures with due regard for any legal requirements regarding confidentiality.',\n",

If a company subject to the NFRD wants to the meet the recommendations of the TCFD regarding the location of its climate - related disclosures, it should publish these disclosures in its management report. \\uf0b7 The materiality perspective of the NFRD covers both financial materiality and environmental and social materiality, whereas the TCFD has a financial materiality perspective only. In principle therefore, information considered material from the perspective o f the TCFD should also be material from the perspective of the NFRD. \\uf0b7 The TCFD states that its recommended disclosures related to Strategy and to Metrics and Targets should be subject to a financial materiality assessment. The TCFD does not, however, stat e that a materiality assessment should apply to its recommended disclosures on Governance and Risk Management, implicitly proposing that its disclosures on Governance and Risk Management should be made irrespective of materiality. Therefore, a company want ing to implement the TCFD recommendations may need to disclose certain information even if that information is not required according to the NFRD. 35 Implementing the Recommendations of the TCFD - Appendix 2 Glossary: Financial Filings refer to the annual reporting packages in which organisations are required to deliver their audited financial results under the corporate, compliance, or secu rities laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. While reporting requirements differ internationally, financial filings generally contain financial statements and other information such as governance statements and management commentary.',\n",
