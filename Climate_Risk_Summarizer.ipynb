            "page 1 : risks and would provide investors wi th a more balanced perspective of the overall impacts of climate on a company’s business and operating performance .312 c. Final Rule s We are adopting final rule s (Item 1502(a)) to require the disclosure of any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, with several modifications in response to commenter concerns . 313 We disagree with t hose commenters who stated that a climate -related risk disclosure provision was not necessary because the Commission’s general risk factors disclosure rule already requires such disclosure . 314 In our view, a separate disclosure provision specifically focus ed on climate -related risks will help investors better understand a registrant’s assessment of whether its business is, or is reasonably likely to be, exposed to a material climate -related risk, and thereby enhance investor protection. Many commenters ind icated that the Commission’s current disclosure rules, including the general risk factor provision, has not provided investors with disclosure of climate - related ris ks and their financial impacts at the level of detail sought by investors that would make the disclosure useful for their investment or voting decisions. 315 The final rules , by contrast, are responsive to investors’ need for decision -useful information regarding registran ts’ material climate -related risks and will help ensure investors receive more consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures about such risks .316 312 See, e.g. , letters from Morningstar; P wC; and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (Jun. 16, 2022) (“WBCSD”). 313 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 314 See supra note 284 and accompanying text. 315 See, e.g. , supra note 102 and accompanying text; infra notes 395-397 and accompanying text. 316 See supra notes 244-249 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 2 : Furthermore, adopting a climate -related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions (set forth in Item 1500) and is based on the climate -related disclosure framework of the TCFD, with which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardiz ing climate -related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful information for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already providing some climate -related disclosure based on the TCFD framework. At the same time , we recogniz e that many commenters expressed significant concerns about the scope of the proposed rules , indicating that they may elicit too much detail, may be costly or burdensome, could result in competitive harm, or may obscure other material information .317 We have sought to address these concerns by modifying the definition of climate -related risks , by making the climate -related risk disclosure requirements less prescriptive, and by specifying the time frame s during which a registrant should describe whether any such material risks are reasonably likely to manifest , as discussed below .318 The proposed rule would have required a registrant to describe any climate -related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business or consolidated financial statements. We have substituted “results of operations” and “financial condition” for “consolidated financial statements” here and in several of the final rule provisions to be more consistent with other Commission rules relevant to risk assessment, such as Item 303 of Regulation S -K regarding MD&A. We have used the term “business strategy” in the final rules to more closely align the final rule s with the TCFD recommendation regarding the disclosure of the impacts of climate -related risks on strategy. T hese revisions do not create any 317 See supra notes 283 and 285. 318 See infra section II.C.2.\n",
            "page 3 : substantive differences compared to the proposed rules but should facilitate compliance because many registrants should be familiar with the terminology used. Similar to the rule propos al, the final rules define climate -related risks to mean t he actual or potential negative impacts of climate -related conditions and events on a registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.319 To make a registrant’s determination of whether it is exposed to a material climate -related risk less burdensome, in respons e to commenters’ concerns,320 we have eliminated the reference to negative climate -related impacts on a registrant’s value chain from the definition of climate -related risk s. This change means that a climate -related risk involving a registrant’s value chain would generally not need to be disclosed except where such risk has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to materially impact the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, because a registrant may be able to assess the material risks posed by its value chain without having to request input from third parties in its value chain, this change will also limit the burdens of climate risk assessment on parties in a registrant’s value chain that might have occurred under the rule proposal. 321\n",
            "page 4 : regarding burdens associated with obtaining climate risk informatio n about their counterparties over which they lack control.323 Similar to the rule proposal, “acute risks” is defined as event -driven risks and may relate to shorter -term severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes , and wildfires .324 “Chro nic risks” is defined as those risks that the business may face as a result of longer term weather patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought, as well as related effects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased h abitability of land, and decreased availability of fresh water.325 These enumerated risks are provided as examples of the types of physical risks to be disclosed and many represent physical risks that have already impacted and may continue to impact registrants across a wide range of economic sectors.326 The final rules define “ transition risks ” largely as proposed to mean the actual or potential negative impacts on a registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition attributa ble to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate -related risks. 327 For reasons discussed above in relation to the definition of “climate -related risks ,” we are no longer including value chain impa cts in the definition of “transition risks. ”328 The final rules’ definition of “ transition risk s” includes the same non- 323 See, e.g. , letter from Chamber. 324 See 17 CFR 229.1500. See infra section II.K.3.c.v for a discussion of the phrase “severe weather events” as used in s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K and Article 14 of Regulation S -X. 325 See id. 326 As discussed in more detail in section II.K.3.c.v , although Article 14 of Regulation S -X req uires a registrant to disclose certain financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which may include weather events that are not climate- related, subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K does not require the disclosure of material impact s from non -climate -related weather events. 327 See 17 CFR 229.1500. 328 As noted above , a registrant would only need to disclose the transition risk of a party in its value chain when such transition risk has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to materially impact the registrant itself.\n",
            "page 5 : exclusive list of examples of transition risks as the rule proposal. Transition risks include, but are not limited to, increased costs attributable to climate -related changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for carbon -intensive products leading to decreased sales, prices, or profits for such products, the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant’s customers or business counterparties) that might trigger changes to market behavior, changes in consumer preferences or behavior, or changes in a registrant’s behavior. 329 Although some commenters asked the Commission to provide additional examples of transition risks in the definition,330 we decline to do so. The final rules’ examples are non - exclusive331 and, c onsistent with the TCFD framework, a registrant’s description of its material transition risks should include any type of transition risk that is applicable based on its particular facts and circumstances.332 The particular type of material transition risk disclosed may be one that is not included or only partially included in the definition. Not every manifestation of transition risk, however, may apply or be material to every registrant and transition risks are dynamic and may change over time .\n",
            "page 6 : The proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose certain items of information about any material climate -related risk that a registrant has identified.333 In order to help address comment ers’ concerns that the rule proposal was too burdensome and could result in the disclosure of immaterial information , we have revised Item 1502, as adopted, to be less prescriptive . In doing so, we have sought to strike an appropriate balance between providing investors with more consistent and decision- useful information about material climate -related risks while being conscious of the costs to registrants and investors of requiring specified disclosures that may not be relevant in every circumstance. T he final rules provide that a registrant that has identified a climate -related risk pursuant to Item 1502 must disclose whether the risk is a physical or transition risk , providing information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presente d and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk.334 The final rules then provide a non- exclusive list of disclosure s that a registrant must disclose as applicable: • If a physical risk, whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk , and the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk;335 and • If a transition risk, whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and in vestor preferences), or other transition - related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.336 333 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. 334 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 335 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i). 336 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(ii ).\n",
            "page 7 : When proposing the climate -related disclosure rules, the Commission stated that in some instances, chronic risks might give rise to acute risks . For example, a drought (a chronic risk) might contribute to wildfires (an acute risk) , or increased temperatures (a chronic risk) might contribute to severe storms (an acute risk) . In such instances, the Commission indicated that a registrant should provi de a clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk , as well as how those risks have evolved or are expected to evolve over time.337 The final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. We agree, however, with commenters that indicated that requiring a discussion about the interaction of two related physical risks may, due to its complexity, increase the burden on the registrant without yielding a corresponding benefit for investors.338 While a registrant may opt to provide such discussion, it is not a mandatory disclosure item under the final rule s. We also agree with commenter s that stated that, for complex and overlapping physical risks, registrants can determine how best to categorize the physical risk as either acute or chronic.339 What is important is that a registrant describ e the climate -related physical risk s it faces cle arly and consistently, including regarding the particular categories of physical risk. As a disclosed risk develops over time, for example where the category of physical risk has changed and/or the nature of the impact to the registrant has evolved, depending on the facts and circumstances, the registrant may need to describe the changed risk in order for an investor to understand the impact 337 See Proposing Re lease, section II.B.1. 338 See, e.g. , letters from C EMEX ; Eni SpA; and ERM CVS. 339 See letter from IAA.\n",
            "page 8 : or reasonably likely impact of the risk on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Some commenters opposed proposed Item 1502 because in their view it would be difficult for a registrant to distinguish between a climate -related physical risk and an ordinary weather risk,340 or between a business activity in response to a transition risk and one that is part of a routine business strategy.341 While we recognize that application of some of the Commission’s climate disclosure rules may initially be difficult for certain registrants , we expect that comp liance will become easier as registrants grow more familiar with disclosing how climate -related factors may impact their business strategies.342 In this regard, we note that many registrants are already providing some of the TCFD -recommended disclosures, a lthough in a piecemeal fashion and largely outside of the registrant’s Commission filings. In addition, we have modified the proposed rules in several places to require disclosure only if a registrant is already undertaking a particular analysis or practi ce or has already made a judgment that a particular risk is climate -related .343 Further, the lengthy phase in periods for the final rules will provide registrants additional time to develop, modify, and implement any processes and controls necessary to the assessment and reporting of a ny material climate -related risk.344 340 In this regard, a ccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) , weather refers to short -term changes in the atmosphere whereas climate describes what the weather is like over a long period of time in a specific area . See NOAA, What’s the Difference Between Weather and Climate? , available at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather -vs-climate . 341 See supra notes 289 and 298. 342 We also expect that compliance with the final rules will become easier as registrants commence disclosing climate -related information pursuant to other jurisd iction s’ climate disclosure requirements , to the extent those requirements are similar to the final rules . 343 See, e.g. , infra section II.D. 344 See infra s ection II.O.\n",
            "page 9 : The final rule s include several changes from the proposal that mitigate some of the burdens of Item 1502(a) , as it was proposed. For example, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk, and to provide the Z IP code or other subnational postal zone.345 The final rules we are adopting no longer require such disclosure and instead include , as one of the physical risk items that a registrant must disclose, as applicable, the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the identified physical risk .346 This revision is intended to address the concern of many commenters that the proposed Z IP code disclosure requirement would be burdensome to produce and would likely not provide useful information for many investors.347 This revision will give registrant s the flexibility to determine the granularity of any location disclosure s based on their particular facts and circumstances as long as they provide information necessary to understand the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the material risk . The proposal would have called for specific information about physical risks, such as disclosures relating to flooding and the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high water stress. In particular, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant that faces a material physical risk due to flooding or water stress to disclose the percentage of buildings, plants, or properties that are located in flood hazard areas or the amount and percentage of assets located in water -stressed areas. In a change from the rule proposal, we have eliminated this proposed requirement in order to make the final rules less burdensome and permit the registrant 345 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. 346 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1). 347 See supra note 286 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 10 : to determine the particular metrics that it should disclose, if any, based on its particular facts and circumstances. Instead, the physical risk disclosure provision we are adopting is less prescriptive and subject to the general condition applicable to both physical and transition risk disclosure that, when describing a material climate -related risk, a registrant must provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. 348 These revisions help address the concern of some commenters that the proposed disclosure req uirements were too prescriptive and could result in overly granular and immaterial disclosure.349 The less prescriptive approach of the final rules also address es the concern of some commenters that the resulting disclosure could cause investor confusion by obscuring other disclosed risks that are presented in less detail .350 We expect that the final rules will elicit disclosures more reflective of a registrant’s particular business practices . With respect to those commenters who stated that th e required metrics disclosure should cover more than just water -related physical risks , the less prescriptive approach in the final rules eliminates any potential overemphasis on water -related physical risks and gives registrants flexibility to describe an y physical risks they may be facing .351 Finally , the revised approach in 348 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 349 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; CEMEX; NAM; and SIFMA. 350 See supra note 287 and accompanying text . As described below, the addition of materiality qualifiers to certain of the final rule’s climate risk disclosure requirements will also help address this concern by eliciting detailed disclosure only when it is material. See infr a section II.D. 351 See, e.g. , letters from CalPERS (recommending that the Commission should also require information on areas subject to droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires ); IAA (recommending that the Commission requir e registrants to provide quantitative details of the volume or revenue (percentage) contribution for facilities located in areas subject to water scarcity , flood risk , wildfires , and other climate -related natural disasters ); and Morningstar (recommending that the Commission go further in mandating quantitative disclosures related to a registrant’s assets exposed to physical climate risk, as such data is important across economic sectors).\n",
            "page 11 : the final rules will allow a registrant’s disclosures to adapt to changing circumstances over time, while still providing sufficient information for investors to understand and assess any such changes. Similar to the physical risk rule provision, the final rule requires registrants to disclose the nature of any transition risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. It also includes a non- exclusive list of disclosures the registrant must provide, as applicable, including whether the transition risk relates to regulatory, technological, market , or other transition -related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant . 352 Describing the nature of an identified transition risk in this manner will help i nvestors understand the realized or potential material impacts of the identified transition risk and whether and how a registrant intends to mitigate or adapt to such risk. Consistent with the rule proposal, the final rule provision states that a registrant that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has made a GHG emissions reduction commitment should consider whether it may be exposed to a material transition risk related to the implementation of the commitment. 353 Including this guidance within the rule text will serve to 352 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a) and 1502(a )(2). In a change from the proposal, the final rules omit a spec ific reference to liability and reputational factors from the transition risk disclosure required pursuant to Item 1502(a)(2). This change was made in order to conform more closely to the definition of “transition risks” in Item 1500, which refers to “regulatory, technological, and market changes.” Although this definition refers to impacts to a registrant’s liability or reputation as non -exclusive examples of negative impacts resulting from such changes, the definition of transition risks also refers to other examples of negative impacts that are not specifically mentioned in Item 1502(a)(2). To streamline the Item 1502(a)(2) disclosure requirement, and to avoid giving undue emphasis to impacts to a registrant’s liability or reputation over other transit ion risk -related impacts, we have removed the specific reference to liability and reputational factors and have retained the more general reference to “other transition -related factors.” A registrant that, due to regulatory, technological, or market changes, has incurred or is reasonably likely to incur a material negative impact to its reputation or liability will be required to include a description of such impact, together with any other material transition -related impact, in its disclosure pursuant to Item 1502(a)(2). 353 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)( 2).\n",
            "page 12 : remind registrants operating in such a jurisdiction that they may need to provide disclosure to investors about this specific type of transition risk. The proposed rule provisions pertaining to governance, strategy, and risk management would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to describe any climate -related opportunities it was pursuing when responding to those provisions.354 In this regard, the Commission proposed a definition of “climate -related opportunities” that was similar to the corresponding definition provided by the TCFD.355 While we are retaining the optional approach to disclosure related to climate -related opportunities, unlike the proposed rules, the final rules do not refer to climate - related opportunities and therefore do not include a corresponding definition. W e are treating the disclosure of climate -related opportunities the same as other voluntary disclosure. Accordingly, despite the absence of a corresponding provision, a registrant may elect to also include disclosure regarding any material climate -related opportunities it is pursuing or is reasonably likely to pursue in addition to disclosure regarding mat erial climate -related risks .356 2. Time Horizons and the Materiality Determination (Item 1502(a)) a. Proposed Rule The rule proposal would have required a registrant to describe any climate -related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact, which may mani fest over the short, medium, and long term. The rule proposal also would have required the registrant to describe how it defines 354 See Proposing Release, s ections II.B through II.E. 355 Compare Proposing Release, s ection II.B (proposing to define “climate -related opportunities to mean the actual or potential positive impacts of climate -related conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains, as a whole ) with TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures , Appendix 5 (defining “climate -related opportunity” to mean “ the potential positive impacts related to climate change on an organization ”). 356 Registrants have a fundamental obligation not to make materially misleading statements or omissions in their dis closures and may need to provide such additional information as is necessary to keep their disclosures from being misleading. See 17 CFR 230.408 and 17 CFR 240.12b- 20.\n",
            "page 13 : “over whatever time period is relevant to a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances ”).371 Some commenters recommended bifurcating the climate risk disclosures into short -term and long- term timeframes, without a medium -term timeframe, similar to certain MD&A disclosures .372 One of those commenters stated that imposing a different temporal standard for climate risk disclosure would pose meaningful challenges to management as they seek to adapt their strategies and could result in misalignment of c limate -related disclosures with “ other, potentially more critical, strategically relevant disclosure issues, including the financial statements and MD&A. ”373 c. Final Rule In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact , a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters .375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long- term (i.e ., 371 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; and SIFMA; see also letter from NAM (stating that the relevant time periods should be short -term (18 to 24 months) and long- term (anything over 24 months), according to the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances). 372 See letter from ABA. 373 See id. 374 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 375 See, e.g. , letter from ABA.\n",
            "page 14 : beyond the next 12 months) .376 The existing MD&A standard also generally requires that a registrant “ provide insight into material opportunities, challenges and risks, such as those presented by known material trends and uncertainties, on which the company’ s executives are most focused for both the short and long term, as well as the actions they are taking to address these opportunities, challenges and risks .”377 We are adopting this temporal standard to address the conce rn of commenters that imposition of a different temporal standard (and, in particular, one that includes a “medium term” period) for climate risk disclosure would pose challenges and potentially conflict with a registrant’s assessment of other risks and ev ents that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its future operations. 378 We note, however, that a registrant is not precluded from breaking down its description of risks reasonably likely to manifest beyond the next 12 months into components that may include more medium - and longer -term risks, if that is consistent with the registrant’s assessment and management of the climate -related risk. We are modeling the temporal standard in Item 1502(a) on this MD&A standard as recommended by commente rs because t he materiality determination that a registrant w ill be required to make regarding climate- related risks under the final rules is the same as what is generally required when preparing the MD&A section in a registration statement or annual report .

A s defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important when determining whether to buy or sell securities or how to vote or such a reasonable investor would view omission of the disclosure as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available . 381 The materiality determination is fact specific and one that requires both quantitative and qualitative considerations.382 379 See 17 CFR 229.303(a). 380 See Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Infor mation , Release No. 33 -10890 (Nov. 19, 2020), [86 FR 2080, 2089 ( Jan. 11, 202 1)] (“2020 MD&A Adopting Release”). 381 See 17 CFR 230.405 (definition of “material”); 17 CFR 240.12b- 2 (definition of “material”).

            "page 16 : The “reasonably likely” component of the rules we are adopting, as with the same standard in MD&A regarding known trends, events , and uncertainties , is grounded in whether disclosure of the climate -related risk would be material to investors and requires that management evaluate the consequences of the risk as it would any known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty. Accordingly, management should make an objective evaluation, based on materiality, including where the fruition of future events is unknown.383 D. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Disclosure of Material Impacts (Item 1502(b), (c), and (d)) a. Proposed Rules The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate -related risks that it must disclose pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) .384 The Commission further proposed to requir e a registrant to include in such description any impacts on its: principles) . Staf f accounting bulletins are not rules or interpretations of the Commission, nor are they published as bearing the Commission's official approval. They represent interpretations and practices followed by the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant in administering the disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. Staff accounting bulletins and any other staff statements discussed in this release have no legal force or effect: they do not alter or amend applicable law, and they create no new or additional obligations for any person. 383 See, e.g. , 2020 MD&A Adopting Release. As noted above, the materiality determination that a registrant will be required to make regarding climate -related risks under the final rules is the same as what is generally required when preparing the MD&A section of a registration statement or annual report. Accordingly, registrants can look to the guidance in the 2020 MD&A Adopting Release regarding application of the “reasonably likely” standard when considering their disclosure obligations under the various components of Item 1502. According to this guidance, the reasonably likely standard “ is not intended to, nor does it require, registrants to affirm the non- existence or non -occurrence of a material future event. ” Rather, “it requires management to make a thoughtful and objective evaluation, based on materiality, including where the fruition of future events is unknown. ” 2020 MD&A Adopting Release , 86 FR at 2093. 384 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.1.\n",

Final Rules The final rule provision (Item 1502(b)) will require a registrant to d escribe the actual and potential material impacts of any climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) on the registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook.422 Information about the actual and potential material impacts of climate -related risks on a registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook is central to understanding the extent to which a registrant’s business strategy or business model has changed, is changing, or is expected to change to address those impacts . This information is also central to evaluat ing management’s response to the impacts and the resiliency of the registrant’s strategy to climate -related factors as it pertains to the registrant’s results of 419 See letter from ABA. 420 See, e.g. , letters from Amazon; Beller et al.; and ICI. 421 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; Beller et al.; and Walmart. 422 See 17 CFR 229.1502(b). As used in the final rules , the term “ outlook” means “the prospect for the future,” consistent with its general definition . See Merriam -Webster Dictionary, available at https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/outlook . For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term “outlook” is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or forecasts in response to Item 1502(b) .\n",
            "page 18 : operations and financial condition. N umerous commenters on the proposal shared some or all of these views .423 The proposed rule did not specifically include a materiality qualifier when requiring a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of any identified climate -related risk in response to proposed Item 1502(a) . In practice, however, proposed Item 1502(b) would have elicited disclosure focused on material impacts because proposed Item 1502(a) would have required a registrant to describe only those climate -related risks that the registrant ha d identified as having materially impacted or being reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant .424 Nevertheless, w e recognize that , as proposed, Item 1502(b) may have caused some confusion regarding the scope of the proposed disclosure requirement.425 Some commenters misinterpreted the rule proposal as requir ing the disclosure of actual or potential impacts of climate -related risks, regardless of their materiality.426 We have, therefore, added an explicit materiality qualifier to Item 1502(b) to clarify that a registrant is only req uired to disclose material impacts of climate -related risks that it has identified in response to Item 1502(a). T his clarifying amendment will help address commenters’ concerns that the proposed rule could result in the disclosure of large amounts of imma terial information and thus be unduly burdensome for registrants . Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule provision was not necessary because the Commission’s existing rules generally require a registrant to disclose the effects of material 423 See supra note 395 and accompanying text. 424 See supra s ection II.C.1.a. 425 See, e.g. , letter from Fenwick West. 426 See, e.g. , letter s from Fenwick West ; and RILA.\n",
            "page 19 : risks, including c limate -related risks .427 However, as other commenters have stated, many compani es do not discuss any climate -related risks in response to existing disclosure requirements .428 Accordingly, a rule provision that specifically requires the disclosure of material impacts of climate -related risks , and lists the types of potential material impacts that must be described, if applicable, will provide investors access to this information on a more consistent and comparable basis .429 The final rule provision largely lists the same types of potential material impacts of climate -related risks as under the rule proposal. The list, which is intended to be non- exclusive , includes , as applicable, material impacts on the registrant’s: • Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations; • Products or service s; • Suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available; • Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes; and • Expenditure for research and development. If none of the listed types of impacts or any other impacts are material, a registrant need not disclose them. Similarly, if a registrant has identified a climate -related risk that has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to impact its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, but th e actual and potential material impact on its strategy, business 427 See supra note 414 and accompanying text. 428 See supra note 397 and accompanying text. 429 See, e.g. , letters from A mer. for Fin.

By providing a non- exclusive list of material impacts of climate risks in the rule text, but not mandating that all or only these impacts be disclosed, the final rule will help elicit more meaningful and relevant disclosure without overburdening registrants or investors with the presentation of irrelevant information. We have revised one of the types of potential material impacts listed in the proposal that referenced “suppliers and other parties in [ a registrant’s ] value chain, ” by replacing this phrase with “[s]uppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available.” This revision is intended to address the concern of some commenters that requiring a registrant to include material impacts to a registrant’s value chain would be overly burdensome to both the registrant and to entities in the registrant’s value chain . 430 Thus the final rule limits the scope of this specific topic to include only material impacts to the registrant’s suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts and further limits the information that should be disclosed about those impacts to information that is known or is reasonably available.431 The adopted provision is consistent with the Commission’s general rul es regarding the disclosure of information that is difficult to obtain , which will apply to the final rules if their conditions are met .432 Accordingly, as modified, this provision will help limit the compliance burden of the final rules by eliminating any potential need for registrants to undertake unreasonable searches or requests for information from their value chains . 430 See supra note 416 and accompanying text. 431 See 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(3). Registrants are required to include material contracts in Commission filings under existing rules. See, e.g. , 17 CFR 229.601(b)(10). 432 See 17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 240.12b -21.\n",

As noted by several commenters, t his provision will help investors assess a registrant’s resiliency to impacts of climate -related risks , by providing information about how management considers the realized or likely impacts of identified material climate -related risks on a company’s business model or strategy.436 In further response to commenters’ concern that the proposed rules were overly prescriptive and could result in a volume of information tha t could be confusing for investors ,437 we have streamlined the Item 1502(c) disclosure requirement. For example, we have omitted from the final Item 1502( c) provision the proposed requirement to “[p]rovide both current and 433 See 17 CFR 229.1502(c). 434 See infra s ection II.G. 435 See infra s ection II .D.2. 436 See supra note 402 and accompanying text. 437 See supra note 415 and accompanying text; see also letters from API; Chamber; NAM; SIFMA; and Soc.

We also have eliminated the requirement to describe how any of the financial statement metrics or GHG emissions metrics relate to the registrant’s business model or business strategy.439 Although a registrant may choose to include forward- looking information or discuss any climate -related metrics or financial information in response to Item 1502(c), the fina l rule leaves it up to each registrant to determine, based on its particular facts and circumstances, what disclosure is necessary to help investors understand whether and how management has incorporated the material impacts of its climate -related risks into its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation. In addition, to further streamline the disclosure and reduce some of the redundancy in the rule proposal, 440 we have eliminated from Item 1502 (c) the proposed disclosure requirement concerning t he role that the use of carbon offsets or RECs has played in a registrant’s climate - related strategy . Under the final rules, as part of its targets and goals disclosure ,441 a registrant will be required to provide disclosure concerning its use of ca rbon offsets or RECs if they constitute a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve its climate -related targets or goals.442 Given this targets and goals disclosure require ment , explicitly requiring disclosure concerning the use of carbon offsets and RECs in the context of Item 1502(c ) is not necessary . 438 See Proposing Release, section II.C.1. 439 See id. 440 One commenter stated that the Commission should follow the TCFD’s recommendation that “[d]isclosures should be eliminated if they are immaterial or redundant to avoid obscuring relevant information.” Letter from Chamber. 441 See infra s ection II.

            "page 23 : We acknowledge the commenter who recommended that we delete the term “business model” in the proposed disclosure item;443 however, w e have retained the use of th is term in the final rule because requiring a registrant to disclose a material impact on its business model caused by a climate-related risk will provide important information to investors about the effectiveness of the registrant’s climat e risk management that would otherwise be lost were we to omit this reference. In addition, registrants generally should be familiar with the term even if not previously used in Regulation S-K. 444 Moreover, the TCFD uses that term in connection with disclosure about the resilience of a company’s strategy to climate- related risks , and as such, using the concept in the final rules will provide consistency for those registrants that have been providing climate -related inform ation based on that framework. 445 If a registrant has not yet articulated a business model, or does not believe that its business model is or will be materially impacted by climate -related risks, it need not provide the disclosure specified in this rule provision. Proposed Item 1502(d) would have required a registrant to provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any climate-related risks described in response to proposed Item 1502(a) have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant’s consolidated financial statements. 446 When proposing Item 1502(d), the Commission explained that this provision was intended to elicit a discussion of the financial effects of climate -related risks similar to 443 See letter from ABA. 444 See, e.g., b usiness model, Oxford English Dictionary (2023), available at https://doi.org/10.1093/OED/2631068139 ; and business model, Cambridge Business English Dictionary (2023), available at https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/business -model . 445 See TCFD, supra note 159, at Table A2.1; IFRS, IFRS S2 Climate -related Disclosures ( June 2023); See also IFRS, IFRS S2 Accompanying Guidance on Climate -related Disclosures (June 2023 ). 446 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.1.\n",

In a change from the proposal, Item 1502(d) (2) will require a registrant to describe quantitatively and qualitatively the material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, in management’s assessment , directly result from activities to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks disclosed pursuant to Item 1502(b)(4).451 Focusing the disclosure requirement on material expenditures that, based on management’s assessment, were incurred as a direct result of the registrant’s mitigation or adaptation activities w ill provide investors with a financial metric that is important to assessing the registrant’s management of the disclosed risk , 447 See id. 448 See supra note 415 and accompanying text. 449 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d) (1). 450 As previously noted, several commenters recommended making or linking any climate -related financial disclosure requirements under or with MD&A disclosure requirements.

At the same time, linking the disclosure of the expenditures with management ’s assessment that they directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will more closely align the disclosure requirement with how the registrant actually evaluates a material climate -related risk . This will not only provide investors with important information about a registrant ’s strategic decision -making concerning a material climate -related risk but should also help the registrant determine whether there are material expenditures that must be disclosed, thereby lower ing the compliance burden, as some commenters noted.452 This disclosure requirement is intended to capture actual material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year for the purpose of climate -related risk mitigation or adaptation . As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant’s climate -related goals as part of a registrant’s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. 454 Although this commenter recommended that suc h expenditures disclosure be presented in tabular format, the final rule provision does not specify a particular format. The 452 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; and P wC. 453 See infra s ection s II.D.2 .c and II.G.3.a for a similar material expenditures disclosure requirement , respectively, as part of a registrant’s transition plan disclosure under Item 1502(e) and targets and goals disclosure under Item 1504 of Regulation S -K. To the extent that there is any overlapping disclosure of material expenditures in response to these Items, to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment , such disclosure is most appropriate, and then cross -reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items. 454 See letter from Amazon. As examples o f transition activities expenditures, this commenter presented costs and expenses related to electrifying its delivery fleet, renewable energy purchases, and carbon offset purchases. See id ., Appendix A.\n",

A registrant ma y present the material expenditures disclosure in tabular or narrative form according to how it believes such information best fits within its overall climate risk disclosure.455 Likewise, the final rules provide registrants with more flexibility than that suggested by the commenter to determine which and to what extent expenditures must be disaggregated or otherwise broken out. T his disclosure requirement covers material expenditures for the mitigation or adaptation of both physical risks and transition r isks. The final Regulation S-X provisions that we are adopting, on the other hand, do not cover financial impacts caused by transition risks .456 This Regulation S -K provision, therefore, will elicit disclosure s about material expenditures related to activ ities engaged in for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate -related risks in Commission filings while avoiding the difficulties of reporting such information in a note to the financial statements, as proposed.457 As discussed in more detail below,458 we recognize that some commenters on the proposed Regulation S -X amendments expressed concern regarding the attribution of expenses to climate risk mitigation activities. Specifically, these commenters stated that regist rants make business decisions, such as incurring an expenditure to purchase a piece of machinery that is 455 The structured data requirements set forth in It em 1508 will facilitate investors’ ability to find and analyze material expenditures disclosure regardless of whether provided in tabular or narrative form . See infra section II.M.3. 456 See infra s ection II.K . In addition, in a change from the proposal, the amendments to Reg ulation S-X do not require the disclosure of expenditures to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions . Therefore, under Item 1502, investors will also receive information about expenditures re lated to the mitigation of physical risks that they will not otherwise receive in the disclosures required by the amendments to Regulation S-X. 457 See supra note s 409 and 452 and accompanying text. The amendments to Regulation S-X will require the disclosure of expenditures related to carbon offsets and RECs, a type of transition activity, if carbon offsets and RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plans to achieve its disclosed climate - related targets o r goals in a note to the financial statements.

In addition, in responding to the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the expenditure and how management has determined that it is a direct result of the disclosed transition activities , which may help alleviate concerns about potential liability exposure for attribution decisions .460 Requiring the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, from management’s assessment , directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will also provide investors with important information that will help them understand a registrant ’s climate risk management and assess any effects on its asset valuation and securities pricing.461 Registrants will similarly have the flexibility to explain qualitativ ely the nature of the impact on financial estimates and assumptions and how, in management ’s assessment , it is a direct result of the disclosed mitigation or adaptation activities.

Transition Plan Disclosure (Items 1500 and 1502(e)) a. Proposed Rule The Commission proposed to require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate -related risk management strategy to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks.464 The proposed requirements were int ended to help investors understand how a registrant intends to address identified climate -related risks and any transition to a lower carbon economy while managing and assessing its business operations and financial condition. The Commission proposed to define “transition plan” to mean a registrant’s strategy and implementation plan to reduce climate- related risks, which may include a plan to reduce its GHG emissions in line with its own commitments or commitments of jurisdictions within which it has significant operations. To allow for an understanding of a registrant’s progress to meet its plan’s targets or goals over 462 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; Cohn Rez ; HP; and IMA. 463 We are providing the same one- year phase in for the material expenditures disclosure requirement s being adopted in connection with a transition plan or a target and goal .

As noted in the Proposing Release, registrants may a dopt transition plan s to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks as an important part of their climate -related risk management strategy, particularly if the registrant has made commitments, or operates in a jurisdiction that has made commitments , to reduce its GHG emissions.498 We recognize that not every registrant has a transition plan and, as noted above, this rulemaking does not seek to prescribe any particular tools, strategies , or practices with respect to climate -related risks . If, however, a registrant has adopted such a plan, information regarding the plan is important to help investors evaluate a registrant’s management of its identified climate -related risks and assess the potential impacts of a registrant’s strategy to achieve its short - or long- term climate -related targets or goals on its business, results of operations, and/or its fina ncial condition. Moreover, a registrant’s transition plan may have a significant impact on its overall business strategy, for example, where companies operate in jurisdictions with laws or regulations in place designed to move them away from high emissions products and services.499 Because th e steps a registrant plans to take pursuant to its transition plan may have a material impact on its business , results of operations, or financial condition, investors have sought more detailed disclosure about transition plans .500 497 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (definition of “ transition plan ”). 498 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.2. 499 See supra s ection II.A. 500 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; BNP Paribas; and Morningstar.\n",

We are cognizant, however, of commenters’ concerns th at the proposed transition plan disclosure provision was overly prescriptive and could result in immaterial disclosure or discourage registrants from adopt ing a transition plan to avoid having to describe the plan in detail .504 To address these concerns, w e have significantly streamlined the transition plan disclosure provision and revised the provision so that the description of a transition plan is only required if a registrant has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk.

This effect may be attenuated, as some commenters indicated, 515 if registrants that have disc losed a plan wish to inform investors about progress achieved pursuant to the plan. In any event, if a registrant is using a transition plan to manage a material transition risk, we think it is appropriate for registrants to provide ongoing disclosure about the plan so that investors can assess its impact on the registrant’s business. 516 As previously noted, however, we are agnostic about whether or how a registrant is managing its 511 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; Amer. for Fin.

In a modification of the proposed rule, which would have generally required the disclosure of the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage transition risk under a transition plan , the final rule will require a registrant, as part of its updating disclosure, to i nclude quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates a nd assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions taken under the plan.517 While this provision is similar to Item 1502(d), Item 1502(e) differs in that it is intended to elicit disclosure about material expenditures and material impacts on financ ial estimates and assumptions that directly result from actions taken under a transition plan (e.g., material expenditures made for climate- related research and development ). Item 1502(e) is not limited to disclosure concerning expenditures and impacts th at directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities ;518 however, t o the extent that a registrant’s disclosure made in response to Item 1502(d) or Item 1502(e) overlap with each other or with disclosure required under any other subpart 1500 provision,519 the registrant need not repeat the disclosure.

We believe that if a registrant has adopted a transition plan to manage a material transition risk , it is likely that management will oversee actions taken under the plan and, therefore , any material expenditures or material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that are disclosed will have been assessed by management as being the direct result of such actions. As under Item 1502(d), when responding to Item 1502(e), a registrant will have flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of a material expenditure or material impact on its financial estimates or assumptions and how it directly resulted from the disclosed actions taken under the plan. Additionally, when considering which expenditures related to actions taken under a disclosed plan are material over the relevant period and therefore require disclosure, if individual expenditures do not appear to be material , regi strants should consider whether overall expenditures related to actions taken under the plan are material in the aggregate and, if so, provide appropriate disclosure. For example, a series of individually immaterial expenditures could be the result of the same action or related actions under the plan, and those expenditures could be material in the aggregate .

A registrant will not be required to comply with either provision until the fiscal year immediately following the fisca l year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status .522 As recommended by one commenter,523 we have removed the reference to physical ris ks that was in the proposed rule .524 This change will make the transition plan disclosure requirement more consistent with voluntary disclosures that are based on the TCFD’s recommendation s,525 which may mitigate the costs and complexity of complying with t he final rule for registrants already familiar with the TCFD’s framework .526 A registrant that faces a material physical risk , however, will still be required to disclose how it is managing that risk as part of its risk management disclosure.527 These revisions will elicit material information for 521 We remind registrants that while they are permitted to cross -reference to information in their financial statement s to satisfy t heir Regulation S -K disclosure obligations , they are not permitted to cross -reference to Regulation S -K disclosures in their financial statements, unless otherwise specifically permitted or required by the Commission’s rules or by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the Interna tional Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) , whichever is applicable.

Similarly , modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to require disclosure only when a plan has been adopted to manage a material transition risk will further help to mitigate this concern. Th is added flexibility regarding transition plan disclosure will also help address concerns that the final rule could act as a disincentive to adoption of transition plans. 529 While the final rules seek neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the adoption of transition plans, we recognize that the compliance burdens of disclosure may influence some registrants’ decisions with respect to risk management practices and have therefore sought to mitigate such effects .\n",

Like the proposal, t he final rule does not require a registrant to disclose climate -related opportunities included in its transition plan. Nevertheless , as previously mentioned, a registrant may still elect to describe any opportunities that it intends to achieve as part of its transition plan discussion or when responding to any of the Item 1502 provisions . 531 We decline, however, to follow the recommendation of one commenter to require the disclosure of how a registrant intends to achieve any climate -related opportunities t hat are a part of its transition plan. 532 Consistent with the rule proposal, we have determined to treat disclosure regarding climate -related opportunities as optional , among other reasons, to allay any anti - competitive concerns that might arise from a req uirement to disclose a particular business opportunity.533 We believe those concerns could be exacerbated by requiring disclosure not only of the existence of opportunities in the transition plan but also how the registrant intends to achieve those opportunities. 3.

The disclosure of a registrant’s use of scenario analysis can provide important forward -looking information to help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant’s strategy under various climate -related circumstances.560 Scenario analysis has increasingly been recognized as an important analytical tool in assessing a company’s climate -related risk 556 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; and Chevron. 557 See letter from Amazon. 558 See, e.g. , letters fro m Anthesis; Bloomberg; CalSTRS; Chevron; and Shell plc (June 17, 2022) ( “Shell”). 559 See, e.g. , letters from American Council of Life Insurers (June 17, 2022) (“ACLI”); J.

Therefore, similar to the proposed rule, the final rule’s scenario analysis disclosure requirement will depend on whether and how a registrant use s such analysis . Importantly, the rule will not require a ny regist rant to conduct scenario analysis . We are, however , adopting modifications in the final rules . For example, we have added a materiality qualifier regarding the disclosure of scenario analysis to address commenters’ concern that the proposed requirem ent could result in disclosure of immaterial information that 561 See, e.g. , letter from AllianceBernstein (stating that “[s]cenario analysis is particularly important for those registrants in emissions -intensive industries where such analysis can demonstrate the quality of impairment testing and increase confidence in asset values”). The Federal Reserve Board’s climate scenario analysis pilot program, in which six of the nation's largest banks are voluntarily participating, further demonstrates the increased recognition of scenario analysis as an important tool to assess climate -related financial risks . See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board announces that six of the nation’s largest banks will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise designed to enhance the ability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate -related financial risks (Sept. 29, 2022), available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220929a.htm . 562 See, e.g. , letters from AllianceBernstein (stating that “[w]hile many registrants claim to perform scenario analysis, however, there is little disclosure around assumptions used in these models and how registrants use results impact strategy, business and capital allocation decisions, making their results challenging t o compare”); and Ceres ( citing evidence from the Climate Action 100+ Benchmark that companies ’ “scenario analys es leave much room for improvement ”). 563 See supra note 543 and accompanying text.\n",

We also have streamlined the proposed scenario analysis disclosure requirements to reduce redundancy in the final rules .

See 17 CFR 229.1500 (“S cenario analysis means a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of outcomes of various possible future climate scenarios, and how climate- related risks may impact a registrant’s business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition over time .”) We have deleted from the definition the example that “registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies un der certain future climate scenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 °C, 2 °C, and 1.5 ºC above pre - industrial levels ” because we do not wish to convey the impression that these scenarios are required should a registrant elect to conduct scenario analysis . 567 See 17 CFR 229.1502(f). Conversely, if a registrant conducts scenario analysis and determines from its results that it is not likely to be materially impacted by a climate -related risk, no disclosure about its use of scenario analysis is required under Item 1502(f). 568 See id.\n",
            "page 42 : provision in the rule proposal requir ing a registrant to describe the resilience of its business strategy in light of potential future changes in climate -related risks . Because companies use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their business strat egies under varying future climate scenarios, and because such use is explained in the definition of scenario analysis (in Item 1500) that we are adopting largely as proposed,569 if registrants are required to disclose their use of scenario analysis under t he final rules, such disclosure likely would include a description of the resilience of their strategies under various climate scenarios. The rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose “any analytical tools, such as scenario analysis” that it uses to assess the impact of climate -related risks on its business. In a modification of the proposed rule, we have eliminated the reference to “any analytical tools” to clarify that the disclosure required by this provision should concern the re gistrant’s use of scenario analysis rather than an y other analytical tool s. We note that the TCFD’s guidance discusses scenario analysis as the primary tool to help companies assess the impacts of climate - related risks on their business strategies , and therefore this change should eliminate any confusion about what other analytical tools might fall under the scope of the requirements .570 In another change from the rule proposal, we have added the term “brief” to modify the “description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used” prong of the scenario analysis disclosure provision. The adopted provision will continue to el icit disclosure that will enhance investors’ assessment of the resiliency of a registrant’s strategy while also mitigating the compliance burden for registrants . Requiring a brief description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used , together with a description of the projected material financial 569 See 17 CFR 229.1500. 570 See TCFD, supra note 332332.\n",
            "page 43 : impacts on the registrant’s business strategy under each scenario, should help elicit disclosure that neither burdens investors with immaterial detail nor unduly adds to a registrant’s complianc e burden. As with disclosure related to transition plans, we reiterate that our focus in adopting these requirements is neither on incentivizing nor disincentivizing any particular risk management practice but rather on providing investors with the inform ation they need with respect to the particular practices of a registrant in order to make informed investment and voting decisions. These revisions to the proposed rule also address commenters’ concern that the required scenario analysis disclosure could result in the disclosure of confidential business information. 571 If a registrant has used scenario analysis to determine that an identified climate- related risk is likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, it is important for investors to receive disclosure about that material impact. T he registrant will not, however, be required to provide a lengthy description of the underlying parameters and assumptions that may be more likely to reveal confidential business information. Although some commenters recommended that we require the use of one or more climate scenario m odels, 572 the final rules do not impose a ny specific risk management model . By requiring disclosure based on whether a registrant has determined to conduct scenario analysis as part of its consideration of material climate -related risks, a registrant will be able to select the climate scenario model or models that it believes best fits its particular industry or business , or its climate risk assessment approach . This approach will provide useful information to investors 571 See supra note 552 and accompanying text. 572 See supra note 558 and accompanying text.\n",

The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered “ an increase of no greater than 3 ºC, 2 ºC, or 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels .”573 Because th is was for illustrative purposes only, and because we have removed the same example from the definition of scenario analysis to avoid conveying the impression that these scenarios are required ,574 we have also removed the example from Item 1502(f). To further streamline the scenario analysis disclosure requirement , we have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information.575 We recognize that, as noted by some commenters, scenario analysis practices are still evolving,576 and that, in the early stages of use, a registrant’s disclosure regarding its use of scenario analysis may be qualitative. As a registrant’s use of scenario analysis becomes more sophisticated, we would expect its disclosure of the results of scenario analysis to become more quantitative, particularly when discussing the expec ted material financial impacts on the registrant’s business strategy, under each considered scenario, which, like the proposed rule, must be addressed should a registrant be required to disclose its use of scenario analysis. Streamlining the proposed scenario analysis disclosure requirement in this way will enable a registrant to determine the mix of qualitative and quantitative disclosure that best fits its particular circumstances when satisfying its obligations under the final rule . 573 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.4. 574 See supra note 566 and accompanying text. 575 See id. 576 See, e.g. , letters from Bloomberg; and Chamber.\n",

Disclosure of a Maintained Internal Carbon Price (Item 1502(g)) a. Proposed Rule The Comm ission proposed to define an internal carbon price to mean an estimated cost of carbon emissions used internally within an organization.578 The Commission also proposed that, if a registrant maintains an internal carbon price, it would have to disclose: • The price in units of the registrant’s reporting currency per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (“ CO 2e”); • The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over time, if applicable; • The boundaries for measurement of overall CO 2e on which the total price is based , if different from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure provision; and • The rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.579 The proposed rules would have further required a r egistrant to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage climate- related risks.

Final Rule The final rule (Item 1502(g)) will require a registrant that uses internal carbon pricing to disclose certain information about the internal carbon price , if such use is material to how it evaluates and manages a climate- related risk that, in response to Item 1502(a), i t has identified as having materially impacted or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. At the same time, we recognize commenters’ concern that, without a materiality qualifier, the proposed rule could have result ed in the disclosure of internal carbon pricing data that would 606 See letter from Chevron (recommending “a disclosure requirement similar to FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 932, which requires a standardized measure of discounted future cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves quantities, often referred to as the standardized measure of oil and gas, or SMOG”). 607 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g). 608 See supra notes 581-585 and accompanying text. We also note, based on current voluntary reporting, a n increasing trend among public companies to use internal carbon pricing. See CDP, Putting a Price on Carbon (2021), available at https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp- production/cms/reports/documents/000/005/651/original/CDP_Global_Carbon_Price_report_2021.pdf .\n",

If a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing is material, similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will require it to disclose in units of the registrant’s reporting currency: • The price per metric ton of CO 2e; and • The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over the time periods referenced in Item 1502(a), as applicable .610 Similar to the proposed rule, if a registrant uses more than one internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate -related risk, it must provide the required disclosures for each internal carbon price, and disclose its reasons for using different prices.611 We also have included a provision, similar to the rule proposal and as recommended by some comm enters,612 stating that if the scope of entities and operations involved in the use of a described internal carbon price i s materially different than the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of calculating a registrant’s GHG emissions pursuant to the final rule , the registrant must briefly describe this difference.613 609 See supra note 600 and accompanying text. 610 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(1). 611 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(2). 612 See supra notes 592-593 and accompanying text. 613 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(3).\n",

Moreover, including a requirement to disclose any material difference in the boundaries used for internal carbon pricing and GHG emissions measurement will help minimize investor confusion about the scope of entities and oper ations included in a registrant’s application of internal carbon pricing and improve transparency about the methodology underlying the use of internal carbon pricing so that investors may better compare such use across registrants . 615 To streamline the internal carbon price disclosure requirement and to reduce redundancy, we have eliminated the proposed requirement to describe how a registrant uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage climate- related risks. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is likely to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate- related risk when responding to other final rule provisions, such as when describing a related transition plan,617 even if the description of internal carbon pricing is less detailed because it is part of a broader narrative discussion.

Moreover, eliminating the proposed requirement to provide a separate narrative description of how a registrant uses an internal carbon price and the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied will help address commenters’ concerns that the proposed disclosure requirement would result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information and act as a disincentive to using an internal carbon pricing mechanism . 619 We also note that, as with tra nsition plan and scenario analysis disclosure, disclosure of a registrant’s use of an internal carbon price will be subject to a safe harbor. 620 Because of these changes to the proposed rule, we believe that it is unnecessary to adopt an exemption or excep tion to the internal carbon price disclosure requirement , as some commenters recommended,621 or a separate phase in for the disclosure requirement, as recommended by other commenters .622 618 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. 619 See supra note 596 and accompanying text. 620 See infra s ection II.J. 3. 621 See supra note s 602-603 and accompanying text. 622 See supra note 604 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 50 : c. Final Rule We are adopting the proposed requirement s to disclose board oversight of climate -related risks (Item 1501(a)) , with some modifications to address the concerns of commenters. These disclosures will enhance investors ’ ability to evaluate a registrant’s overall manag ement of climate -related risks by improving their understanding of the board’s role in overseeing those risks .665 The final rule will require a description of a board of directors’ oversight of climate - related risks, as proposed.666 The final rule will also require the identification , if applicable, of any board committee or subcommittee responsible for the oversight of climate -related risks and a description of the processes by which the board or such committee or subcommittee is informed about such risks . Further, if there is a target or goal disc losed pursuant to § 229.1504 or transition plan disclosed pursuant to § 229.1502(e)(1), the final rule will require disclosure of whether and how the board oversees progress against the target or goal or transition plan.667 These disclosures are not requir ed for registrants that do not exercise board oversight of climate - related risks. Despite the concerns expressed by several commenters, the proposed rules were not intended to shift governance behaviors , including board composition or board practices . Similarly, the final rule s neither seek to influence registrants ’ decisions about how to manage climate -related risks nor does their design incorporate, reflect , or favor any governance structure 665 See, e.g. , letters from Ceres ; PRI; and RMI. 666 We are also adding Instructio n 1 to Item 1501 to clarify that in the case of a foreign private issuer with a two-tier board of director s, the term “ board of directors ” means the supervisory or non -management board. In the case of a foreign private issuer meeting the requirements of 17 CFR 240.10A –3(c)(3), the term board of directors ’ means the issuer ’s board of auditors (or similar body) or statutory auditors, as applicable . 667 The proposed governance provision state d that a registrant may also describe the board of directors’ oversight of climate -related opportunities. As previously mentioned, although the final rules do not contain a similar provision, a registrant may elect to provide such disclosure as part of it s governance disclosure.\n",

Rather, consistent with our statutory authority, the final rules focus on disclosure of registrants’ existing or developing climate -related risk governance practices. We recognize that registrants have varied reasons for pursuing different oversight arrangements, and some registrants may reasonably de termine that climate -related risks are not among the most pressing issue facing the company. The final rule s will provide investors with the information they need to understand and evaluate those oversight arrangements and make informed investment decisio ns in light of their overall investment objectives and risk tolerance . Furthermore, as stated above, these disclosure requirements apply to those registrants the boards of which exercise oversight of climate -related risks ; no disclosure is required for re gistrants that do not have information responsive to the disclosure requirements . We are not adopting some of the more prescriptiv e elements of the proposal in response to commenter concerns. Specifically , we are eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose: • The identi ty of specific board members responsible for climate -risk oversight; • Whether any board member has expertise in climate- related risks and the nature of the expertise; • How frequently the board is informed of such risks ; and • Information regarding whether and how the board sets climate -related targets or goals, including interim targets or goals. While the proposal would have required this disclosure only to the extent applicable, we appreciate the concerns of some commenters who stated that these elements of the proposal could have unintended effects on the registrant’s governance structure and processes by focusing on one area of ris k at the expense of others . In addition, some commenters raised concerns that the level of detail required by the proposal would cause registrants to divulge sensitive internal\n",
            "page 52 : board processes . It may be that a registrant, in describing “ the board of directors’ oversight of climate -related risks ,” will find it necessary to disclose, or otherwise choose to disclose , some or all of the information called for by the proposal. But , by adopting a more streamlined rule, we intend to eliminate any mis percept ion that this information is required for all registrants , particularly those without existing processes or information to disclose . We are, however, adopting the proposed requirement to identify any board committee or subcommittee responsible for the ove rsight of climate -related risks , if a registrant has such a committee or subcommittee. T his information is important to an understanding of how the board is managing such risk and will not be burdensome to disclose . Moreover, the provision simply require s the registrant to identify any committee or subcommittee that has been tasked with managing climate -related risks and is not designed to influence decisions about whether and how the board allocate s responsibility for oversight of such risk. We are also adopting a requirement, albeit modified from the proposal, to describe whether and how the board of directors oversees progress against disclosed climate -related tar gets, goal s, or transition plan s. By tying this disclosure requirement to circumstances in which the registrant has a disclosed climate -related target , goal , or transition plan, the final rule will avoid generating detailed disclosure about matters that are not important to investors. In addition , in light of commenter concerns regarding the proposed disclosure of whether and how the board of directors establishes any final or interim targets or goals,668 we are omitting this requirement from the final rule. Overall, the less prescriptive approach to disclosure in the final rule will facilitate investors ’ understanding of how a registrant intends to manage a target or goal that is material to its business while 668 See supra note 663 and accompanying text.\n",

We are also adopting the proposed requirement to describe the processes by which the board or a ny board committee or subcommittee is informed about climate -related risks, while eliminating the requirement to describe the frequency of these discussions . While some commenters stated that it would be helpful to investors for registrants to disclose both the processes and frequency of these discussions ,669 other commenters expressed concern that this disclosure will shift governance behavior.670 The final rules balance investors’ need to understand the board’s governance of climate- related risks in sufficient detail to inform an investment or voting decis ion with concerns that the proposal could inadvertently pressure registrants to adopt specific or inflexible climate -risk governance practices or organizational structures or otherwise influence the conduct of the board. By retaining the requirement to disclose the process by which the board is informed, investors will have meaningful information that they can use to assess the conduct of boards in dealing with climate -related risks while avoiding overly detailed or granular disclosure s that could unduly influence such processes . Although some commenters asserted that registrants may feel pressure to appoint certain individuals with climate expertise,671 we re emphasize that the Commission remains agnostic about whether and/or how registrants govern clima te-related risks . Registrants remain free to elect whether and how to establish or retain the procedures and practices that they determine best fit their business . The focus of the final rules remain s on investor protection and improving 669 See, e.g. , letter s from FTLT ; Morningstar ; and PRI. 670 See supra note 655. 671 See supra note 646.\n",

The final rules are focused on disclosure and do not require , and are not formulated to prompt, registrants to chang e their governance or other business practices. We are not, as suggested by some commenters, adopting a materiality qualifier for this portion of the final rule. As discussed above, we have revised the final rule from the proposal to make the disclosure requirement less prescriptive. As such, registrants wil l have additional flexibility to determine how much detail to provide about the board’s oversight of climate -related risk. T hese revisions help mitigate some comme nters’ concerns that the rule will require disclosure of immaterial information. T he specif ic information called for by the final rule will provide important context for an investor to evaluate the extent to which the board is evaluating climate -related risk s. If a board of directors determines to oversee a particular risk, the fact of such ove rsight being exercised by the board is likely material to investors given other demands on the board’s time and attention .672 Moreover, unlike management, which likely oversees many more routine matters, some of which may not be material to investors, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to the company and limited in number. Accordingly, we do not believe that a materiality qualifier is necessary for this provision. 2. Disclosure of Management Oversight (Item 1501(b)) a. Proposed Rules Similar to the proposed disclosures on board oversight, the proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose a number of it ems, as applicable, about management’s role in the assessment and managem ent of climate -related risks. First, the Commission proposed to require 672 See discussion infra section II.E.2.c ( regarding our reasons for adding a materiality qualifier to Item 1501(b) ).\n",
            "page 55 : optional and not mandatory,706 others indicated that how companies are responding to highly dynamic opportunities is material information and therefore should be required to be disclosed.707 One commenter stated that climate -related opportunity reporting is likely to be adopted in both the EU and UK , and t herefore, to streamline mandatory disclosures for dual ly- listed co mpanies , the commenter recommended that the Commission require this disclosure , except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant’s principal line of business .708 c. Final Rule We are adopting the proposed requirement to disclose management oversight of climate related risks (Ite m 1501(b)) with some modifications t o address the concerns of commenters. The final rule s will, like the proposed rules, require that registrants describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate -related risks . As commenters stated , investors need information about how management -level staff assess and manage material climate -related ris ks to make informed investment and voting decisions. However, we are limiting the disclosure required by this final rule provision to material climate -related risks , as suggested by commenters ,709 given the multitude of climate -related matters that may be overseen by management . The final rule s also specif y that a registrant should address, as applicable, the following non- exclusive list of disclosure items when describing management’s role in assessing and managing the registrant’s material climate -related risks : • Whether and which management positions or committees are responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risks , and the relevant expertise of such position holders or 706 See, e.g. , letter from CEMEX. 707 See, e.g. , letter from CHRE and Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. 708 See, e.g. , letter from We Mean Business Coalition (June 1 3, 2022) (“We Mean Business”). 709 See, e.g. , letters from MFA ; and RILA.\n",

The n on-exclusive list of disclosures in Item 1501(b) should help elicit specific information about management’s oversight of climate -related risks and thereby mitigate any tendency towards boilerplate disclosures. At the same time , by focusing the disclosure on management ’s role in assessing and managing material climate -related risks , the final rules will provide registrants with the flexibility to tailor the disclosures based on their particular governance structure . Given these changes, we believe the final rule appropriately balances investors’ needs for information to understand management’s involvement in assessing and managing material climate risks with concerns that a more prescriptive rule could have adverse consequences on registrants’ governance practices or organizational structures. We reiterate, as we did above with respect to our rules requiring disclosure of board oversight of climate -related risks, that the final rule does not seek to influence decisions about how to manage climat e-related risks or otherwise change registrant behavior . Rather, the final rule seek s to elicit disclosure about existing oversight practices that will allow investors to make better informed judgments about registrants’ oversight processes and mechanisms in light of their overall investment objectives and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the final rule does not require registrants that do not engage in the oversight of material climate -related risk to disclose any information.\n",
            "page 57 : We are mindful of the suggestions of some commenters that we adopt additional requirements to disclose information related to management oversight of climate -related risks, including descriptions of internal positions and reporting structures and detailed information about clim ate-based remuneration . However, consistent with our overall goal to streamline the proposed requirements and to focus on management’s over sight of material climate -related risk , we are not including such additional disclosure elements in the final rule.710 We are adopting the proposal requir ing a description of the relevant expertise of position holders or members responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risk .711 While we considered the view of commenters that this could cause registrants t o feel compelled to find and hire management with such expertise, regardless of whether that is the most sensible use of managerial resources given the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances , the added qualification that disclosure is only required where the risk is material mitigates this concern. We agree with commenters that asserted that this information will be helpful to understanding a registrant’s ability to manage climate -related risk s given the direct role that management will play in overseeing any such risks yet emphasize that registrants are required to make this disclosure only if they have identified a material climate risk . As noted above, the final rule has been modified to eliminate many of the prescriptive disclosure elements from the proposal , and it instead provides a non -exclusive list of the types of 710 Although we are not adopting specific requirements related to e xecutive management remuneration linked to climate -based incentives , to the extent a climate -related target or goal or other measure is a material element of a registrant’s compensation of named executive officers, such information is required to be disclosed under Item 402(b) of Regulation S -K. 711 Further, we are addin g Instructio n 2 to Item 1501 to clarify that r elevant expertise of management in Item 1501(b)(1) may include, for example: p rior work experience in climate -related matters; any relevant degrees or certifications; any knowledge, skills, or other background in climate -related matters .\n",

For example, if applicable , registrants should describe the processes by which certain positions or committees are informed about and monitor climate -related risks. A process -based description of management’s governance of material climate -risks can offer investors a meaningful look at how registrants manage material climate -related risk s. Registrants should also disclose, if applicable, whether management reports to the board or a subcommittee of the board on climate -related risks. Elimination of the proposed requirement to disclose how frequently the board meets to discuss climate -related matters, as discussed above, address es commenters’ concerns that this disclosure , if provided, could divert limited resources from the consideration of other material risks and encourage changes to business practices . Nonetheless , information on whether management reports to the board can provide needed clarity on the connection between board and management level governance of climate -related risks , and accordingly, we have retained it as an example of the type of disclosure that might be responsive to the rule . We have also added a reference to a subcommittee of the board because some registrants may establish a subcommittee to focus on climate -related issues. Finally, as noted above ,712 we are not adopting the proposed rule that would have allowed , but did not require , registrants to describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate -related opportunities. As with other voluntary disclosure, registrants may elect to include su ch disclosure. While we recognize that some commenters recommended that such disclosure be mandatory, we have determined to treat the disclosure regarding climate - 712 See section II.C.1.c.\n",

In addition, the flexibility afforded to re gistrants under the final rule to determine which details about management’s oversight of climate -related risks to include in their disclosure will help alleviate concerns that the proposal would elevate climate -related disclosures above other , equally important, disclosures . Furthermore, as stated above, the final rule does not impose any disclosure requirements on registrants that do not exercise management oversight of climate - related risks. 713 See Proposing Release, s ection II.A.1. 714 See, e.g. , letter from BIO. 715 See, e.g. , letter from Chamber (“ We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk.

Final Rule After considering the comments received, we are ad opting a requirement (Item 1503), modified from the proposal as discussed below , to describe any processes the registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks.763 We agree with those commenters that stated investors need more comprehensive disclosure of registrants’ climate - related risk management practices to inform their investment and voting decisions.764 Because climate -related risks can have material impacts on a registrant’s business, it is important for investors to have information available to them so that they can understand how a registrant identifies, assesses, and manages any such risks . At the same time, we are mindful of commenters’ suggestions , both for this risk management disclosure in particular and climate - related disclosure s more generally, that the Commission promulgate rules that allow registrants to tailor the disclosure of material climate -related risks and related management practices to their own particular facts and circumstances.765 Accordingly, we are adopting a less prescriptive approach that focuses on a description of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks . In doing so, we have sought to avoi d imposing a “ one-size- fits- all” disclosure model 766 that fails to account for differences in industries and businesses and that 762 See, e.g. , letters from Chamber; IECA; and J. Weinstein. 763 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a). As noted in section II. D.2.c above, we have moved the disclosure requirement concerning a registrant’s transition plan to the 17 CFR 229.1502. 764 See, e.g. , letters from Ceres; C2ES; PWHC; SKY Harbor; and WSP. 765 See supra note 730 and accompanying text. 766 See, e.g. , letters from API; Chamber; and SIFMA.\n",

As a number of commenters indicated, consistent information about a registrant’s management of climate -related risks is vital to informed investment and voting decisions .767 Despite the importance of climate -related risk management information to investors, only a minority of registrants currently include such information in their voluntary climate reports or in their Exchange Act filings .768 We considered comments that the proposed disclosure requirem ents are redundant because existing rules already require disclosure about material risks in annual reports, but we continue to believe that a specific disclosure item focused on managing material climate -related risks is warranted. While registrants may be required to disclose certain climate -related information in filings made with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure requirements, as noted above769 there is a need to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of disclosures about c limate -related risk management for investors given that, as noted above, most r egistrants are not currently including the type of information called for by the final rules in voluntary climate reports or Exchange Act filings .770 We also considered comments that the proposal placed undue emphasis on climate -related risks and , as discussed below, have made a number of changes in response to streamline the requirements and focus on materia l climate - related risks . 767 See supra note 727 and accompanying text. See also Anthesis (stating that the SEC should require the registrant to disclose its process for identifying climate risks with the highest materiality and explain its adaptation/mitigation plan to build resiliency ). 768 See TCFD, 2022 Status Report (Oct. 2022) , available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2022/10/2022- TCFD -Status -Report.pdf (indicating that only approximately one -third of over 1,400 public companies surveyed provided disclosure concerning climate risk management processes in their 2021 re ports). 769 See supra note 727 and accompanying text. 770 See section IV.A.5 .\n",
            "page 62 : First, in a change from the proposal, w e have added a materiality qualifier to the disclosure item.771 The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks. I ncluding a materiality qualifier addresses the specific concerns expressed by commenters that the proposal would require registrants to disclose this information in a level of detail that would impose undue costs. If a registrant has not identified a material climate -related risk, no disclosure is required. Given the concerns expressed by commenters that there is a wide range of risks that registrants manage as part of their operations, we are persuaded that it is ap propriate to include a materiality qualifier for this aspect of the proposal to help ensure that the final rule elicits decision -useful information for investors without imposing an undue burden on registrants and placing undue emphasis on climate -related risks that are not material . Similarly , to address the concerns of commenters that the proposed risk management disclosure provision would require registrants to address items that might not be relevant to their particular business or industry,772 we have removed several prescriptive elements from the final rule. Those proposed provisions that we are not adopting would have required a registrant, w hen describing any processes for identifying and assessing climate -related risks, to disclose, as applicable, how the registrant: • Determines the relative significance of climate -related risks compared to other risks; • Considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG emissions limits, when identifying climate -related risks; 771 See supra note 730 and accompanying text. 772 See supra note 730 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 63 : • Considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes, or changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and • Determines the materiality of climate -related risks . Instead, the final rule will allow a registrant , when describing its processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risk s, to determine which factors are most significant , and therefore should be addressed, based on its particular facts and circumstances , which may include information on the items listed above . Commenters that supported the proposal stated that a meaningful description of the processes underlying climate risk management is necessary to enable investors to evaluate registrants’ climate risk management pract ices as part of their investment decisions. T he final rule will elicit disclosures that offer a more complete picture of the management of material climate -related risks while also mitigating concerns that the proposed rule c ould unnecessarily elevate climate- related risk above other important matters and give rise to competitive harm and increased litigation risk for registrants . The final rule will also promote more consistent and comparable disclosure of registrants’ climate -related risk management practices than is current ly available from voluntary reporting and , as these provisions of the final rules more closely align with the TCFD, they may limit costs for those registrants who are familiar with reporting under this framework. The final rule provides that a registrant should address , as applicable, how it identifies whether it has incurred or is reasonably likely to incur a material physical or transition risk.773 This provis ion is similar to the proposed rule that would have required a registrant to describe its 773 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(1).\n",
            "page 64 : processes for identifying a climate -related risk.774 The final rule substitutes the more specific terms “physical risk or transition risk ” for “ climate -related risk ” to clarify and simplify the requirement since Item 1500 defines climate -related risk to encompass physical and transition risks . In addition, because the processes and factors that a registrant may use to identify the two types of risks may differ in certain respects , or in some cases a registrant may face one and not the other kind of risk, this change should elicit more relevant information for investors .775 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule also provides that a registrant should address , as applicable, how it: • Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk;776 and • Prioritizes whether to address the climate -related risk.777 The final rules will help investors to understand the processes that a registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing climate -related risks , consistent with the feedback of many commenters .778 In this regard, commenters further indicated that information concerning how a registrant prioritizes climate -related risks vis -à-vis other risks that the registrant is managing would be particularly useful .779 We are not, however, retaining the proposed requirement to disclose how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high priority risks . In response to the concerns expressed by sever al commenters,780 we have removed this proposed disclosure item t o 774 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.1. 775 See TCFD, supra note 332, at 13 -14 (providing different tables (Tables D2 and D3) outlining the identification and assessment approaches for transition risks and physical risks). 776 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(2). 777 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(3). 778 See supra note 747 and accompanying text. 779 See supra note 749 and accompanying text. 780 See supra note 733 and 734 and accompanying text.\n",

Furthermore, in response to one commenter who supported the proposal but cautioned against an overly broad application,781 we confirm that the final rules do not require registrants to speculate in their disclosures about future restructurings, write -downs, or impairments related to climate risk management. The flexibility afforded by the final rules also helps address the point made by the same commenter that the proposed disclosure item should not compel registrant s to disclose trade secrets or confidential business information. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose whether and how any of the processes it has described for identifying, assessing, and managing the material climate -related risk have been integrated into the registrant’s overall risk management system or processes.782 As some commenters noted, information about how a registrant integrates its clima te risk management processes into its overall risk management system is important to help investors understand and assess the effectiveness of those climate risk management processes . 783 Mandating this disclosure , therefore , will allow investors to make be tter informed decisions about the overall risk profile of their investment in the registrant and provide a measure from which they can evaluate similarly situated companies.784 We are not adopting the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose , if it has a separate board or management committee responsible for assessing and managing climate- 781 See e.g. , letter from BOA. 782 See 17 CFR 229.1503(b). 783 See supra note 753 and accompanying text. 784 See, e.g. , letter from SKY Harbor.\n",

Several commenters stated that the y do not have dedicated board or management committees for managing climate -related risks ,785 or asserted that including such prescriptive elements in the final rule could lead to boilerplate disclosure .786 Having considered these comments, and in light of our overall aim to reduce the prescriptiveness of the proposed requirements, we are not including this disclosure item in the final rule . We believe the other disclosure items we are adopting will still provide investors with decision -useful information about how registrants manage their material climate -related risks. Finally, as noted above,787 we are not adopting the proposed rule that allowed but did not require registrants to describe any processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate - related opportunities when responding to any of the provisions in the risk management section.788 As with other voluntary disclosure, registrants may elect to include such disclosure. While we recognize the recommendation of some commenters that such disclosure be mandatory, consistent with the rule proposal, we have determined to treat disclosure regarding climate -related opportunities as optional , among other reasons, to allay any anti -competitive concerns that might arise from a requirement to disclose a particular business opportunity. 789 785 See, e.g. , letter from BIO. 786 See, e.g. , letter from Chamber. 787 See supra section II.C.1.c. 788 See 17 CFR 229.1503(c). 789 See Proposing Release, s ection II.A.1.\n",

Final Rule a. The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b) , and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant’s climate -related targets or goals in order to understand and assess the registrant ’s transition risk strategy and how the registrant is manag ing the material impacts of its identified climate -related risks . We recognize, however, as some commenters indicated , that an overly broad requirement to disclose any climate -related target or goal, even one that is meant for preliminary, internal planning purposes and that is not yet material, could impose a compliance burden on registrants that may outweigh its benefi t to investors .848 Conditioning the targets and goals disclosure requirement on the target s or goal s being material will help to address this concern by focusing the requirement on the information that is most likely to be decision- useful for investors . If a registrant sets an internal target or goal that materially affect s or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition ( e.g., due to material expenditures or operational changes that are required to achieve the target or goal), then investors should have access to information about that target or goal to help them 846 See letter from CEMEX. 847 See 17 CFR 229.1504(a). 848 See supra notes 823 and 828 and accompanying text.\n",

While some commenters recomm ended that the Commission require the disclosure only of targets or goals that are both material and publicly announced,849 we decline to follow this suggestion. Such a condition would enable a registrant to keep non- public an internal target or goal that is material, which would fail to protect investors by potentially precluding their access to information that is important to make informed investment and voting decisions . We reemphasize, however, that a registrant is not required to disclose an internal target or goal that is not material. In addition, we decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters that the targets and goals disclosure requirement should only be triggered by the board’s or CEO’s formal adoption of the target or goal .850 Such a provision would deprive investors of material information for procedural reasons unrelated to the importance of the information to investors . Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the final rules are intended to elicit material climate - related disclosures for investors and not to influence governance practices regarding climate-related matters. Because registrants may have different processes for setting targets or goals, we believe that materiality is a better threshold for di sclosure of targets or goals than basing the disclosure requirement on an internal process that may differ from company to company. Similarly, a lthough one commenter recommended that the Commission require the disclosure only of targets or goals related to a registrant’s GHG emissions, 851 we decline to follow this recommendation. I nvestors need information about all of a registrant’s material 849 See supra note 829 and accompanying text. 850 See supra note 820 and accompanying text. 851 See supra note 807 and accompanying text.\n",

Although the particular non -GHG emissions target or goal to be disclosed will depend on a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances , to the extent such targets or goals are material, a registrant must disclose them. To simplify the targets and goals disclosure requirement and avoid implying any topical focus regarding the particular targets or goals that should be discussed, we have eliminated from the final rule the parenthetical “e.g., the reduction of GHG emissions or regarding energy usage, water usage, or revenues from low -carbon products .” We also decline to follow the recommendations of some commenters to include provisions that specifically require the disclo sure of targets or goals related to mitigation of impacts on local communities or that concern human capital management goals.852 The final rule is intended to elicit disclosure of any climate -related target or goal that has materially affected or is reaso nably likely to materially affect a registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. Accordingly, any target or goal meeting the conditions of the final rule (including that it is material) will need to be disclosed regardless of the particular issues it address es, if that target or goal is considered climate -related in the registrant’s particular circumstances and if achieving such target or goal would materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition. We note that a registrant may voluntarily disclose additional information that is not required to be disclosed under the final rule (and not part of a target or goal) but that is related to the mitigation of climate -related risks. Similar to the proposed rule, with some modifications as discussed below , the final rule (Item 1504(b)) will require a registrant that is disclosing its targets and goals pursuant to Item 852 See supra note 806 and accompanying text.\n",

In order to address the concern of some commenters that the proposed ta rgets and goals disclosure provision was too prescriptive and would impose a costly compliance burden without necessarily resulting in material information ,854 the final rule has been revised so that the listed items are non- exclusive examples of additional information or explanation that a registrant must disclose only if 853 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b). 854 See supra note 823 and accompanying text.\n",

If a registrant has set a material target or goal to reduce emissions, it will be required to disclose this when explaining the scope of activities included in the target. We also have eliminated the proposed disclosure item regarding whether a target is absolute or intensity -based because this information will likely be elicited by other required disclosure , such as the unit of measurement pertaining to the target or goal. 856 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires discl osure , as applicable, of how the registrant intends to meet its climate -related targets or goals.857 However, in order to help address the concern of some commenters that the proposed rule could result in the disclosure of an excessive amount of detail, the final rule specifies that th is discussion of prospective activities need only be qualitative. In addition, we are eliminating the proposed example that, f or a target or goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could include a strategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase carbon offsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage. 858 This will avoid any misperception that these are required items of disclosure. T he final rule leaves it up to the registrant to determine what 855 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b). 856 In addition, as discussed below in s ection II.H, elimination of this proposed disclosure requirement is consistent with our removal of the proposed requirement to disclose a registrant’s GHG emissions m etrics in intensity terms in addition to absolute terms. 857 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b) (5). 858 See Proposing Release, s ection II.I.\n",

Relatedly, the final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal.863 This disc ussion must include quantitative and qualitative 859 See letter from Unilever. 860 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c). 861 See id. 862 See supra notes 508-514 and accompanying text.

In addition, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright- line thre shold, as was proposed for the Regulation S -X amendments, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. Additionally, when considering which expenditures related to progress under a disclosed target or goal are material over the relevant period and therefore require disclosure, registrants should consider whether overall expenditures related to progress under a disclosed target or goal are material in the aggregate and, if so, provide appropri ate disclosure. Finally, to the extent that disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the target or goal is disclosed in response to Rule 14-02(h) of Regulation S -X, a registrant would be able to cross -reference to such disclosure . 871 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule will permit a registrant to provide the required targets and goals disclosure as part of its discussion pursuant to Item 1502 regarding its transition plan or when otherwise discus sing material impacts of climate -related risks on its business strategy or business model. 872 A registrant will also be permitted to provide the required targets in response to these Items, to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment , such disclosure is most appropriate, and then cross- reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items. 871 See supra note 521. 872 See 17 CFR 229.1504(a).\n",

A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets under the Science Based Targets Initiative, or the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. 875 As we similarly noted when declining to follow a recommendation to broaden transition risk disclosure, the targets and goals disclosure requirement we are adopting is consistent with the TCFD framework, which provides flexibility in terms of whic h tools or methods a registrant chooses to use , and therefore will limit the targets and goals compliance burden for those registrants that are already familiar with the TCFD framework. 876 A registrant may elect to provide disclosure regarding these additi onal items, but they are not required items of disclosure. b. The Carbon Offsets and RECs Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(d)) Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule includes a disclosure requirement about a registrant’s use of carbon offsets or RECs (Item 1504(d)) .

If carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve climate -related targets or goals, then, similar to the proposed rule, the registrant wi ll be required to disclose : the amount of carbon avoidance, reduction or removal represented by the offsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the REC s; the nature and source of the offsets or RECs ; 879 a description and location of t he underlying projects ; any registries or other authentication of the offsets or RECs ; and the cost of the offsets or RECs .880 Information about the source, value, underlying projects, and authentication of the carbon offsets or RECs will help investors evaluate the role of these instruments in a registrant’s climate -related strategy and the impacts on its business . For example, understanding the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in a registrant’s climate -related business strategy can help investors 877 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). 878 See, e.g. , letters from Beller et al .; and J. Weinstein. 879 The nature of an offset refers to whether it represents carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal. The nature of an REC refers primarily to whether it is bundled or unbundled. The source of an offset or REC refers to the party that has issued the offset or REC . Commenters stated that investors need such detailed information about offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a registrant’s transition risk strategy and management of climate -related impacts on its business . See supra notes 831-834 and accompanying text. 880 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). At the recommendation of commenters, see supra note 835, to clarify that an offset can represent carbon avoidance, in addition to carbon reduction or removal, we have added “avoidance” to the definition of c arbon offset . See 17 CFR 229.1500 .\n",

Relatedly, a registrant that relies on carbon offsets or RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve its targets or goals might need to consider whether fluctuating supply or demand, and corresponding variability of price, related to c arbon offsets or RECs, pr esents an additional material risk that is required to be disclosed when discussing its plan to achieve such target or goal pursuant the requirements of subpart 1500. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant’s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant’s business and financial condition. Also , at the recommendation of commenters, we have added the nature of the carbon offsets or RECs as a disclosure item in addition to the source of the offsets or RECs. 883 This addition will help investors understand whether a purchased offset represents carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal, and whether a n REC is bundled or unbundled.

For example, as one commenter noted, a market that develops increased demand for carbon removal offsets, either because of new regulation or stricter voluntary standards for net -zero targets, could result in a significant increase in offset prices , potential supply bottlenecks , and increased transition risk for registrants that assumed the continued availability and abundance of cheaper offsets .886 One commenter who objec ted to the proposed offsets and RECs disclosure requirement asserted that the Commission lack s statutory authority to regulate offsets and RECs.887 We disagree with that commenter ’s characterization of the rule. In requiring the disclosure of certain information about a registrant’s use of offsets or RECs when such use is a material component of the registrant’s plan to achieve a target or goal that is required to be disclosed, we are not advocating for or against the use of offsets or RECs generally, or f or or against the use of certain types of offsets or RECs.

H. GHG Emissions Disclosure (Item 1505) 1. Proposed Rule The proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions888 for its most recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements , to the extent such historical GHG emissions data is reasonably availabl e.889 The Commission based the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement on the concept of scopes, which are themselves based on the concepts of direct and indirect emissions, developed by the GHG Protocol. 890 The Commission proposed to require a regis trant to disclose its Scope 1 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by a registrant. 891 The Commission also proposed to require a registrant to disclose its Scope 2 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or 888 We proposed to define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO 2”); methane (“CH 4”); nitrous oxide (“N 2O”); nitrogen trifluoride (“NF 3”); hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”); perfluorocarbons (“PFCs”); and sulfur hexafluoride (“SF 6”). The greenhouse gases included in the proposed definition reflect the gases that are currently commonly referenced by international, scientific, and regulatory authorities as having significant climate impacts. This list of constituent gree nhouse gases is consistent with the gases identified by widely used frameworks, such as the Kyoto Protocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the EPA, and the GHG Protocol. See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.a. 889 See id . 890 Direct emissions are GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a registrant, whereas indirect emissions are GHG emissions that result from the activities of the registrant but occur at sources not owned or c ontrolled by the registrant.

Final Rule a. Overview of th e GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement As many commenters have indicated, investors view information about a registrant’s GHG emissions , including its Scope s 1 and 2 emissions, as a central measure and indicator of the registrant’s exposure to transition risk as well as a useful tool for assessing its management of transition risk and understanding its progress towards a registrant’s own climate -related targets no later than the due date for the Form 10- Q for the second quarter in the subsequent fiscal year); and SIFMA (recommending inclusion in the Form 10- Q for the second quarter in the subsequent fiscal year or in a Form 6 -K furnished at a comparable time). 1001 See letter from Cleary Gottlieb. 1002 See, e.g. , letters from Blackrock; and GM (suggesting alignment with GHG emissions reporting de adline of other agencies (90- 120 days after fiscal year -end)). 1003 See, e.g. , letters from ACLI; Can.

We recognize commenters’ concerns about the potentially high cost of compliance associated with the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement, including Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1009 as well as concerns about th e current availability and reliability of the underlying data for Scope 3 emissions .1010 To help address these concerns, instead of requiring, as proposed, the disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by all registrants regardless of their materiality , the final rules will require the disclosure of Scope 1 emissions and /or Scope 2 em issions metrics1011 by LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs , on a phased in basis,1012 if such emissions are material.1013 1008 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; AllianceBernstein; CalPERS; CalSTRS; IAA; Miller /Howard; Morningstar; Trillium; and Wellington Mgmt. 1009 See supra note s 933 to 935 and accompanying text. 1010 See supra note s 924-925 and accompanying text. 1011 The concept of scopes was developed as part of the GHG Protocol. See World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) , available at https://ghgprotocol.org/s ites/default/files/standards/ghg -protocol - revised.pdf . We understand that some registrants may measure their GHG emissions pursuant to other well- established standards, such as ISO 14064 and related ISO standards, which do not refer to scopes. For the purposes of the final rules, we have defined “Scope 1 emissions” and “Scope 2 emissions,” respectively, as a registrant’s direct emissions and indirect emissions largely from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity consumed by the registrant’s operations . We intend these definitions to include substantially similar emissions as those measured pursuant to the ISO standards. Accordingly, registrants have flexibility to leverage standards of their choice in calculating and disclosing GHG emissions metrics required by the final rules, including the GHG Protocol or relevant ISO standards, or other standards that may be established over time. 1012 As discussed in s ection II.O below, LAFs will have a one -year transition period before they are required to comply with the final rule’s GHG emissions disclosure requirement s. AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs will be required to comply with the final rule’s GHG emissions disclosure requirements two years following the GHG emissions compliance date for LAFs. 1013 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a) (1). To the extent Scope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure are required under the final rules, 17 CFR 230.409 or 17 CFR 240.12b- 21, which provide accommodations for information that is unknown and not reasonabl y available, would be available if its conditions are met.\n",

Rather, under the final rule , if either or both of those categories of GHG emissions are material, and the registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than an SRC or EGC , it must disclose its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions metrics .1017 As we stated when discussing a registrant’s determination of material impacts of climate -related risks , we intend that a registrant apply traditional notions of materiality under the Federal securities laws when evaluating whether its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emi ssions are material.1018 Thus, materiality is not determined merely by the amount of these emissions. Rather, a s with other materiality determinations under the Federal securities laws and Regulation S -K, the guiding principle for this determination is whe ther a reasonable investor would consider the disclosure of an item of information, in this case the registrant’s Scope 1 emissions and/or its Scope 2 emissions, 1014 See supra note 916 and accompanying text. 1015 See id . 1016 Although the TCFD has reported a significant increase in the number of companies that have publicly disclosed their GHG emissions across the globe in recent years, a minority of North American and U.S. companies have done so. The TCFD recently reported that only 30% of North American companies surveyed reported their Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions in 2021. See TCFD, supra note 768. 1017 If a registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than a n SRC or EGC and its Scope 1 emissions are material but its Scope 2 emissions are not material, then, under the final rules, the registrant must disclose its Scope 1 emissions and is not required to disclose its Scope 2 emissions (and vice versa if its Scope 2 emissions are material but its Scope 1 emissions are not). If a registrant’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions both are material, then it must disclose both categories of emissions. 1018 See, e.g. , supra note 381 and accompanying text.\n",

A registrant’s Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions may be material because the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to allow investors to understand whether those emissions are significant enough to subject the registrant to a transition risk that will or is reasonably likely to materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition in the short - or long- term. For exampl e, where a registrant faces a material transition risk that has manifested as a result of a requirement to report its GHG emissions metrics under foreign or s tate law1019 because such emissions are currently or are reasonably likely to be subject to additional regulatory burdens through increased taxes or financial penalties , the registrant should consider whether such emissions metrics are material under the final rules . A registrant’s GHG emissions may also be material if the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to enable investors to understand whether the registrant has made progress toward achieving a target or goal or a transition plan that the registrant is required to disclose under the final rules. Conversely, the fact that a registrant is ex posed to a material transition risk does not necessarily result in its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions being de facto material to the registrant. For example, a registrant could reasonably determine that it is exposed to a material transition risk for reasons other than its GHG emissions, such as a new law or regulation that restricts the 1019 See supra section II.A.3 (discussing adoption of the ISSB climate disclosure standard and the foreign jurisdictions that intend to implement the standard and California’s recently adopted laws requiring certain large corporations to disclose their GHG emissions metr ics and their climate -related financial risks).\n",

This approach will also limit the compliance costs of the final rules, as it will not require disclosure of GHG emissions data where such data is immaterial. B asing the GHG emissions disclosure requirement on traditiona l notions of materiality , which ar e fundamental to U.S. securities laws and the Commission’s securities regulation, is more appropriate than a requirement that relies on GHG emissions disclosure law s or regulations required by other Federal agencies and foreign or state jurisdictions , as one commenter recommended .1022 Those other laws or regulations may be adopted to serve other purposes and may be presented without the additional disclosures that supplement the “ total mix ” of information investors need for context and to understand why the GHG emissions information is material. We acknowledge, however, that registrants could incur costs to assess and monitor the materiality of their emissions, even in situations in which they ultimately determine that they do not need to provide disclosure, and that for some registrants these costs could be significant, especially if firms are not already tracking this information for internal purposes.1023 Mindful of 1020 See, e.g. , Simone Foxman, The Electric Revolution Is Coming for Your Lawn Mower , Bloomberg (Nov. 20, 2023), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023 -11-20/gas -lawn -care- ban-in-california - tests-electric -leaf-blower -appeal . 1021 See id. 1022 See letter from Grundfest. 1023 See infra section IV.

These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources and time to prepare for what we acknowledge could be a significant additional compliance obligation.1024 We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. Nevertheless, mindful of the attendant costs, we believe that the final rules present an appropriate means to achieve the primary benefits of GHG emissions disclosure , namely: providing investors with material metrics that will aid in the assessment of transition risk for those registrants that have identified a material climate risk ; and facilitating investors ’ evaluation of a registrant’s progress towards achieving a material target or goal and the attendant effects on the registrant’s business, resul ts of operations, or financial condition. While the final GHG emissions disclosure provision will not apply to as many registrants or achieve the same level of comparability as may have been achieved under the proposed rules, on balance, we believe that, coupled with the other disclosures required under subpart 1500 and the structured data requirements of the final rules, investors will have sufficient information to assess the operational and financial impact of transition risks and strategies on registrants and compare such impacts across registrants . b. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of the Underlying Methodolo gies and Assumptions In a change from the rule proposal , which would have required the disclosure of a registrant’s GHG emissions both disaggregated by each constituent GHG and in the aggregate , 1024 As discussed below, neither EGCs nor SRCs will be required to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions under the final rules.

Final Rules (Item 1506) After considering comments, we are adopting final rules (Item 1506(a)( 1)) that require a registrant, including a foreign private issuer, that is required to provide Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure pursuant to Item 1505 to include an attestation report covering the disclosure of its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions i n the relevant filing.1196 However, as discussed in greater detail below, we made a number of modifications to the proposal to address certain concerns raised by commenters. 1193 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1194 See, e.g. , letters from CEME X; CFA Institute (stating that the issue could be revisited by the Commission in the future); and Grant Thornton. 1195 See letter from ERM CVS. 1196 See 17 CFR 229.1506. Consistent with the Commission’s statement in the Proposing Release, in order to attest to Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure, a GHG emissions attestation provider will need to include in its evaluation relevant contextual information. See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. In particular, under the final rules, the attestation provider will be required to evaluate the registrant’s compliance with (i) Item 1505(a), which includes presentation requirements (e.g., disaggregation of any constituent gas if individually material), and (ii) the disclosure requirements in Item 1505(b) regarding methodology, organization boundary, and operational boundary.

As discussed above, a significant number of commenters supported the Commission’s proposal to require certain registrants to obtain mandatory assurance over GHG emissions disclosure.1201 Many of these commenters agreed with the Commission that mandatory assurance would improve the accuracy, comparability, and consistency of registrants’ GHG emissions disclosure. 1202 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, obtaining assurance over GHG emissions disclosure provides investors with an additional degree of reliability regarding not only the figures that are disclosed, but also the key assumptions, methodologies, and data sources the registrant used to arrive at those figures. 1203 The Commission has long recognized the important role played by an independent auditor in contributing to the reliability of financial reporting.1204 Studie s suggest that investors have greater confidence in information that has been assured, particularly when it is assured at the reasonable assurance level,1205 and that high quality audits reduce the cost of capital,1206 which may benefit both registrants and investors. Similarly, studies of ESG -related assurance, which is typically provided at a limited assurance level, have found benefits such as credibility 1201 See supra note 1105 and accompanying text. 1202 See supra note 1106 and accompanying text. 1203 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1204 See Qualifications of Accountants , Release No. 33 -10876 (Oct. 16, 2020) [85 FR 80508, 80508 (Dec. 22, 2020)].

We considered the view expressed by some commenters that there is no reason to treat GHG emissions disclosures differently than other disclosures located outs ide of the financial statements, which do not require assurance.1210 Although we recognize that registrants may provide quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements that is not subject to any assurance requirement, a s explained in the Proposi ng Release,1211 and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters,1212 GHG emissions disclosures are unique in that many companies currently voluntarily seek third- party assurance over their climate- related disclosures, and commenters, including investor s, have expressed a particular need for assurance over GHG 1207 See, e.g. , Ryan J.

Prescribing a minimum level of assuran ce required for AFs and LAFs over their Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions in the final rules, along with minimum requirements for the GHG emissions attestation provider and the engagement, will enhance comparability and consistency with respect to assurance over GHG emissions disclosures. A few commenters stated that it is unnecessary to mandate assurance because there are existing incentives for accuracy in connection with corporate disclosures, such as the Commission staff ’s filing review process or the possibility of Commission enforcement actions or private litigation. 1213 While it is true that there are existing incentives for companies to provide accurate information to investors, these incentives do not provide the same benefits that assurance will pr ovide under the final rules. Although the desire to avoid an enforcement action or private litigation has a deterrent effect on registrants, such proceedings generally serve to adjudicate claims after investors have allegedly received inaccurate or misleading disclosures. In contrast, the assurance requirement in the final rules will require an independent third- party to provide a check on the accuracy and completeness of a registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure before the information is provided to invest ors, which as explained above, will likely result in additional benefits such as lower cost of equity capital and lower analyst forecast errors. 1214 Furthermore, although the Commission staff ’s filing review process serves a valuable compliance function tha t contributes to investor protection, it is not designed to provide assurance, and certainly not for every filing.

Nevertheless, as noted above, the practice of providing assurance over GHG emissions is far from nascent and is now expected by many market participants.1218 Several commenters urged the Commission to adopt the verification process for GHG reporting used by the EPA in lieu of the proposed assurance requirements.1219 Although we considered the EPA’s multi- step verification process , given the differences in the Commission’s and EPA’s reporting requirements, the different purposes of the Commission’s and EPA’s respective regulatory regimes, and the benefits of third- party assurance, we determined that independent, third- party assurance is a more appropriate model for the final rules.1220 1218 As discussed above, a number of jurisdictions have undertaken efforts to obtain more consistent, comparable, and reliable climate- related information for investors, see supra s ection II.A.3, with certain jurisdictions requiring the disclosure of GHG emissions data along with assurance.

In addition, we disagree with those commenters that suggested we wait before determining whether to adopt a mandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions. 1224 The phase in periods included in the 1221 See supra notes 1131 and 1132 and accompanying text. 1222 See infra section II.I.5. 1223 See supra s ection II.H.3.a. 1224 See supra note 1131 and accompanying text.\n",

Consistent with the proposal, the final rules will apply the attestation requirements to AFs and LAFs. 1225 However, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules will exempt SRC s and EGCs from the requirement to obtain an attestation report.1226 Although some commenters urged the Commission to apply the final rules to all registrants,1227 not just AFs and LAFs, our decision to exempt SRCs and EGCs from the assurance requirement is d riven by our decision to exempt these companies from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions, which is discussed in greater detail above. 1228 Since SRCs and EGCs will not be required to disclose GHG emissions, they also will not be required to obtain assurance. Under the final rules, AFs and LAFs will be required to obtain limited assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505 (the GHG emissions disclosure provision). 1229 LAFs will be required to obtain reasonable assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. 1230 In a change from the proposal, AFs will not be required to scale up to reasonable assurance un der the final rules.

            "page 95 : confidence that a registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure is reliable as compared to limited assurance,1231 we have de termined that it is appropriate to apply the reasonable assurance requirement to a more limited pool of registrants – LAFs – at this time because some LAFs are already collecting and disclosing climate -related information, including GHG emissions data,1232 and larger issuers generally bear proportionately lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of such compliance. This scaled approach will avoid increasing compliance burdens for AFs that may be smaller or less sophisticated issuers. We considered whether to require LAFs to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level from the start as suggested by some commenters. 1233 However, most registrants that are voluntarily obtaining assurance today obtain limited assura nce rather than reasonable assurance,1234 and therefore a transition period is appropriate to give LAFs and GHG emissions attestation providers time to prepare for the higher level of assurance. In contrast to some commenters’ suggestion that obtaining reas onable assurance would be impractical, 1235 we note that some registrants have voluntarily obtained reasonable assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure. 1236 In addition, one commenter stated that it agreed with the Commission’s statement 1231 See, e.g. , letter from GRI. 1232 According to one study, 99% of S&P 500 companies reported ESG information in 2021 and 65% of such companies reported obtaining assurance over some ESG information. See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500-and-esg-reporting . In addition, according to the study, over 63% of S&P 500 companies reported obtaining assurance specifically over some portion of their GHG emissions disclosures . See id. Based on an analysis by Commission staff on Feb. 29, 202 4, a substantial number of the S&P 500 companies (494) are LAFs . 1233 See supra note 1145 and accompanying text. 1234 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500- and-esg-reporting (stating that in 2021 most companies that obtained assurance from public company auditors and other providers opted for limited assurance). 1235 See, e.g. , letter from INGAA. 1236 See supra note 1217.\n",
            "page 96 : in the Proposing Release that limited assurance is not possible unless the assurance provider also believes reasonable assurance is possible on the subject matter.1237 We recognize that obtaining reasonable assurance over GHG emissions disclosure will be more costly than obtaining limited assurance because the scope of work in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than the scope of work in a reasonable assurance engagement. The primary difference between the two levels of assurance relates to the nature, tim ing, and extent of procedures required to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to support the limited assurance conclusion or reasonable assurance opinion. For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). Therefore, we agree with those commenters that stated reasonable 1237 See letter from ERM CVS. As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance engagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the engagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. Thus, if the subject matter i s appropriate for a limited assurance engagement, it is also appropriate for a reasonable assurance engagement. See Proposing Release, section II.H.1 See also, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18 , Attestation Standards, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/ aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae- no- 18.pdf ; and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information , available at https://www.ifac.org/_flysystem/azure - private/publications/files/ISAE%203000%20Revised%20- %20for%20IAASB.pdf . 1238 See, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 105.A14. 1239 See, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 205.18.\n",
            "page 97 : assurance will provide greater value to investors because at the reasonable assurance level, investors receive more reliable information about GHG emissions.1240 Registrants may also benefit from providing disclosures subject to a rea sonable assurance level because such assurance enhances investor confidence in the disclosures, and as a result, may lower the cost of capital for registrants. 1241 As explained above, LAFs are best positioned to bear the increased costs of obtaining reasonable assurance. Such costs are justified for these registrants by the benefits that investors and registrants will receive in the form of positive assurance, which makes it more likely that material errors or omissions are detected and is consistent with the Commission’s investor protection mission. In light of the significant phased in compliance period that LAFs will have before reasonable assurance is required, we expect that registrants will incur these costs over several years, which should make the burden easier to bear in any particular year. We also expect that during the significant phased in compliance period new assurance providers will enter the market and any resulting increase in competition will lead to relative reductions in the costs of providing those services over time. 1242 We considered whether it would be appropriate to wait to make a determination about whether LAFs should be required to scale up to reasonable assurance, but decided against such 1240 See supra note 1145 and accompanying text. 1241 See letter from Anthesis Grp. See also supra note 1207. 1242 See letter from Futurepast ( expressing the view that the existence of a larger pool of potential GHG emissions attestation providers will enhance competition and likely result in lower costs to registrants). In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in Sections II.I.2.c and 3.c., we expect that registrants’ ability to hire a non- accounting firm as a GHG emissions attestation provider and our decision to make certain modifications to the proposed requirements applicable to the GHG emissions attestation engagement should help address concerns about the supply of GHG emissions attestation providers.\n",

We also considered the suggestion by one commenter that the Commission initially require registrants to obtain reasonable assurance, followed by limited assurance engagements to the extent the first year’s attestation report included no qualifications ; however, for the reasons stated above, the scaled approach, starting with limited assurance and subsequently moving to reasonable assurance , will allow LAFs time for their processes and controls to mature before being subject to the higher level of assur ance. It will also provide attestation service providers that do not currently provide assurance over GHG emissions disclosure with additional time to familiarize themselves with providing assurance over such disclosure, which, as noted above, should faci litate additional competition between assurance providers and further help decrease costs of compliance. A number of commenters recommended that the Commission extend the phase in periods in the final rules because the proposed compliance schedule would have been too challenging for registrants to meet. 1244 We agree with commenters that extending the phase in periods would provide registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers with additional time to prepare for implementation of the rules and would allow assurance standards and practices applicable to 1243 See supra note 1193; Brandon Gipper, et al. , Carbon Accounting Quality: Measurement and the Role of Assurance (Nov . 2023) , available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=4627783 (concluding that reasonable assurance improves carbon accounting quality more than limited assurance).

Therefore, as compared to the proposal, the final rules provide AFs and LAFs with additional time before they are required to comply with the GHG emissions assurance requirements in addition to the phased in GHG emissions compliance dates. 1245 Providing two phased in compliance dates —one before registrants are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirem ents and another before registrants are required to comply with the assurance requirements —will allow registrants and assurance providers to gain experience with the new rules before assurance is required. Commenters expressed a variety of views about whether the Commission should define the terms “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” in the final rules. Some commenters stated that definitions or guidance could be helpful or reduce any potential confusion, 1246 while other commenters stated that no definition is needed.1247 We have determined not to include definitions of “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” in the final rules because we agree with the commenters that stated that this terminology is generally well understood1248 and should be defined by assurance standard setters and not by the Commission.1249 As we explained in the Proposing Release, “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” are currently defined by the prevailing attestation standards.1250 Furthermore, we expect the descr iption of the work performed as a basis for the assurance provider’s conclusion on the GHG emissions attestation 1245 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a).

Another commenter urged the Commission to provide a definition of limited assurance that establishes “a process more rigorous than currently used for assurance of quarterly SEC filings.” 1254 However, doing so would potent ially result in the Commission’s definition of limited assurance being different from, or conflicting with, the definitions included in the prevailing attestation standards that we expect many GHG emissions attestation providers will use, which could cause confusion. 1251 See, e.g. , IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) § 69(k) . 1252 See letter from IECA. 1253 For example, the draft interagency report entitled, “Federal Strategy to Advance Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors (Strategy),” states that “Measurement, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MMRV) refers to ac tivities undertaken to quantify GHG emissions and sinks (through direct measurement and/or modeling), monitor emission over time, verify estimates, and synthesize and report on findings.” See Federal Strategy to Advance Measurement and Monitoring Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors , 88 FR 44251 (July 12, 2023). 1254 See supra note 1180.\n",

Consistent with the notice requirements in cluded in Item 1505(c), the final rules (Item 1506(f)) provide that a registrant that elects to incorporate by reference its attestation report from its Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter or to provide its attestation report in an amended annual repor t must include an express statement in its annual report indicating its intention to either incorporate by reference the attestation report from a quarterly report on F orm 10 -Q or amend its annual report to provide the attestation report by the due date specified in Item 1505.1257 1255 See 17 CFR 220. 1505(c)(1).

In addition, at its option, a registrant that is subject to the assurance requirements would be able to obtain any level of assurance over its GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a).1262 For filings made after the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but before Item 1506(a) requires limited assurance, a registrant would only be required to provide the disclosure called for by Item 1506(e).1263 For filings made after the compliance date for assurance required by Item 1506(a) , to avoid potential confusion, the additional, voluntary assurance obtained by 1258 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1259 See supra s ection II.A.3. 1260 See id. for further discussion of presentation requirements for GHG emissions disclosure under the final rules. 1261 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1262 Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosures are required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a).

Final Rules (Item 1506(b)) We are adopting the GHG emissions attestation provider requirements substantially as proposed.1348 We continue to believe that the expertise requirements (Item 1506(b)(1)) are necessary to help ensure that the service provider preparing the attestation report has sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute the attestation engagement. 1349 Several commenters agreed with the proposal’s expertise requirements and definition of significant experience.1350 While some commenters urged the Commission to require a GHG emissions attestation provider to have a certain number of years of experience,1351 other commenters stated that the Commission should not prescribe a minimum number of years.1352 We do not think it is necessary to require a provider to have a certain number of years of experience because imposing such a requirement could result in a “ch eck the box” mentality, and we believe that investors 1346 See, e.g. , letters from BPI; and Financial Services Forum. 1347 See letter from BPI. 1348 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b).

Some commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance regarding the qualifications for a GHG emissions attestation provider; 1353 however, these commenters generally did not identify any particular aspects of the expertise requirement that required clarification. Adopting a principles -based approach inherently involves some uncertainty, but we believe registrants would be better served by such flexibility than an approach that, for example, identifies a static list of qualified providers . Such an approach will provide a registrant with more leeway to s elect a GHG emissions attestation provider that has the experience that best fits the registrant’s facts and circumstances, which could improve the quality of assurance provided thereby enhancing the reliability of GHG emissions disclosures. In response to a question included in the Proposing Release, some commenters stated that the Commission should specify that a GHG emissions attestation provider meets the expertise requirements if it is a member in good standing of a specified accreditation body and i dentified particular bodies or approaches the Commission should consider. 1354 We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. Several commenters recommended that the Commission specify additional qualifications for GHG emissions attestation providers, 1355 and while we considered each of these suggestions, we 1353 See supra notes 1300 and 1301 and accompanying text. 1354 See supra notes 1305 , 1307, and 1308 and accompanying text . 1355 See supra note 1312 and accompanying text.\n",

While a number of commenters urged the Commission to require that a GHG emissions attestation provider be a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB, 1356 we determined to retain the principles -based approach in the final rules because it will provide registrants with the flexibility to hire a non -accounting firm that may have relevant or specialized experience with respect to assuring GHG emissions disclosure while at the same time ensuring that a GHG emissions attestation provider has the requisite expertise to perform the engagement in accordance with professional standards. Although we agree there would be investor protection benefits to be gained by requiring a registrant to use a PCAOB -regulated entity that is subject to oversight and inspections (even though the PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction would not include engagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosure within its scope),1357 we have balanced this against other considerations, such as the availability of GHG emissions providers and compliance costs, which could potentially be lower if a larger pool of assurance providers is available. Nevertheless, we agree with those commenters who stated that if the final rules permit non-PCAOB -registered accounting firms to provide attestation services, the Commission would need to ensure that there are appropriate protections in place for investors. 1358 The expertise, 1356 See supra note 1294 and accompanying text. 1357 The PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of issuers, brokers, and dealers and would not include engagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosure within its scope.

However, as discussed in greater detail below, oversight inspection programs can provide benefits, such as providing a check on a GHG emissions attestation provider’s overall activities and driving improvements in the quality of services overall, even when an oversight inspection program does not include a GHG emissions attestation engagement within its scope . 1358 See supra note 1292 and accompanying text.\n",

As we explained in the Proposing Release, this would mean that the service provider has the qualifications necessar y for fulfillment of the responsibilities that it would be called on to assume, including the appropriate engagement of specialists, if needed. 1360 A few commenters supported a requirement for GHG emissions attestation providers to establish policies and procedures along these lines. 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b).

In this regard, we note that the IAASB and ISO standards, two of the four standards we are explic itly permitting assurance providers to use under the final rules (as discussed in more detail below), are not restricted to CPAs , and we are not aware that any state laws are currently impacting the ability of non -CPA service providers to provide assurance over GHG emissions. With respect to independence, we are adopting each of the independence requirements (Item 1506(b) (2)) as proposed. 1364 These independence requirement s are important because they help ensure that the attestation provider will perform the engagement in an objective and impartial manner. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirement for a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with respect to the registrant and any of its affiliates and agreed that the independe nce requirement would enhance the reliability of the 1362 See letter from PwC. See also letter from NASBA (“Virtually all of the State Boards do not allow non - CPAs to perform attestation services or issue reports u nder the professional standards governing the public accounting profession.”). 1363 By their terms, AICPA and PCAOB attestation standards are only applicable in the context of engagements performed by certified public accountants. See, e.g. , PCAOB AT s ection 101, Attest Engagements, available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/attestation -standards/details/AT101 (stating that “[t]his section applies to engagements . . . in which a certified public accountant in the practice of public accounting . . . is engaged to issue or does issue an examination, a review, or an agreed- upon procedures report on subject matter . . .”) (emphasis added); AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 105.01 (“This section applies to engagements in which a CPA in the practice of public a ccounting is engaged to issue, or does issue, a practitioner’s examination, review, or agreed -upon procedures report on subject matter or an assertion about subject matter (hereinafter referred to as an assertion) that is the responsibility of another party.”) (emphasis added) . 1364 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2).\n",

One commenter appeared to suggest that, under the proposed rules, GHG emissions attestation providers would not be subject to the same level of independence as financial statement auditors. 1368 Although the final rules do not set forth a non- exclusive specification of circumstances inconsistent with independence like Rule 2- 01(c) does for financial statement auditors, the foundational principles underlying the independence requirements in Rule 2- 01 and the final rules are the same ,1369 and we view the independence requirements in the two contexts as providing similar, if not equivalent, protections to investors. However, for the avoidance of any doubt, we are clarifying that registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers are only 1365 See supra note 1317 and accompanying text. 1366 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.2. 1367 See supra notes 1321 and 1324 and accompanying text. 1368 See letter from PwC. 1369 Namely, the final rules provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all iss ues encompassed within the attestation provider’s engagement, which is modeled on Rule 2- 01(b). Compare 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(i) and 17 CFR 210.2- 01(b). Also, the final rules model the factors the Commission will consider in determining whether a GHG emi ssions attestation provider is independent on the introductory text to Rule 2 -01.

The phased in compliance period will give registrants adequate time to find a provider that meets the independence requirements. I t will also give non- accountant attestation providers time to familiarize themselves with the independence requirements and adapt their business practices accordingly, which may help mitigate any adverse effects that the independence requirements could hav e on the available pool of providers. For this reason, we do not think it is necessary, as suggested by some commenters, 1370 The final rules do not alter or amend Rule 2- 01 or its current applicability in any way, which me ans, for example, there is no change to the requirement that registrants and their financial statement auditor comply with Rule 2 -01 with respect to the financial statement audit. 1371 The staff of the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants or GHG emissions attestation providers regarding the independence requirements in the final rules. 1372 See supra notes 1327 , 1328, and 1331 and accompanying text.\n",

A few commenters stated that the proposed rules’ references to accounting or audit -style requirements could favor accounting firms, 1374 and we acknowledge that some of the requirements in the final rule s, such as the independence requirements, may be more familiar to accounting firms versus non- accounting firms. However, we believe the principles -based approach in the final rules generally should be accessible for both accounting and non- accounting firms. Moreover , the phased in compliance period should give non- accountant attestation providers time to f amiliarize themselves with the independence requirements and provide existing service providers with time to unwind any existing conflicts to their independence. Some commenters suggested that the proposed independence requirement was problematic because i t would seem to prohibit an expert or other third- party that has assisted a registrant in calculating or preparing its GHG emissions data from serving as the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider. 1375 We agree that it would be difficult for an exp ert that has assisted a registrant in calculating or preparing its GHG emissions data to meet the independence 1373 See supra note 1335 and accompanying text. 1374 See supra note 1293 and accompanying text. 1375 See supra note 1329 and accompanying text.\n",

As a result, this could mean that a registrant that determines it is necessary to hire a third -party service provider to help it calculate or prepare its GHG emissions disclosure may have to pay a fee to both the third- party service provider and to its GHG emissions attestation provider. H owever, the likelihood of this scenario is reduced by the multiyear phase in compliance period we are adopting, which provides registrants with sufficient time to develop the necessary processes and procedures to calculate their GHG emissions data before t hey are required to comply with the assurance requirements. In addition, the exemption from the GHG emissions reporting and assurance requirements for SRCs and EGCs provides most new ly public companies with time to develop any in- house expertise that may be necessary in case they no longer qualify for SRC or EGC status in the future and become subject to the final rules. In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant’s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). Conversely, we generally expect that a registrant would be able to use its financial statement auditor as its GHG emissions atte station provider consistent with the independence requirement in the final rules . 1377 See supra note 1332 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 114 : note that the Commission’s determination in each of its rulemakings about whether to require a registrant to reta in an independent third- party is context specific. For example, with respect to its mining disclosure rules, the Commission stated that it was not adopting a requirement for a qualified person to be independent from the registrant because, among other thi ngs, the final rules require a registrant to disclose the qualified person’s affiliated status with the registrant or another entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, which is consistent with the Committee for Mineral Reserve s International Reporting Standards’ mining guidelines, to which the Commission was amending its mining rules to more closely align. 1378 With respect to its oil and gas disclosure rules, the Commission pointed out that most commenters did not support a requirement to obtain an independent third- party assessment of reserves estimates because a company’s internal staff is generally in a bet ter position to prepare those estimates and there is a potential lack of qualified third party engineers and professionals available. 1379 However, the Commission did adopt a requirement for a registrant to provide a general discussion of the internal controls it uses to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the disclosure of the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the reserves estimates. 1380 In keeping with this context specific approach, with respect to assurance over GHG emissions disclosure, we believe that the benefits to investors from requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent in accordance with Item 1506 justify the potential costs for the reasons stated above. Moreover, there is currently a growing 1378 See Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants , Release No. 33 -10098 (June 16, 2016) [81 FR 41651, 41661 (June 27, 2016)]; Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants , Release No. 33 -10570 (Oct. 31, 2018) [83 FR 66344 , 66363 (Dec. 26, 2018)]. 1379 See Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Release No. 8995 (Dec. 31, 2008) [74 FR 2157, 2175 (Jan. 14, 2009) ]. 1380 See id.\n",

The independence requirements in the final rules ar e more rigorous and may diffe r in scope from the requirements included in these standards. It is possible that the application of the independence requirements in the final rule s may result in a GHG emissions attestation provider no longer being able to provide certain non- assurance services to its assurance client that may be permissible to provide outside the context of the final rules . 1383 The International Ethics Standards Board for Accoun tants (IESBA), which is an independent global ethics standard -setting board, has recently proposed ethics standards for sustainability assurance providers (i.e., professional accountants and other professionals performing sustainability assurance engagements) , including robust independence standards. IESBA stated that it “holds to the premise that sustainability assurance engagements . . . must be underpinned by the same high standards of ethical behavior and independence that apply to audits of financial information.” See IESBA, Explanatory Memorandum for Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (including International Independence Standards) ( IESSA ) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting , available at https://ifacweb.blob.core.windows.net/publicfiles/2024- 01/Proposed%20IESSA%20and%20Other%20Revisions%20to%20the%20Code%20Relating%20to%20Su stainability%20Assurance%20and%20Reporting%20- %20Explanatory%20Memorandum.pdf . 1384 See supra note 1324. 1385 See letter from RSM .\n",

More generally, we expect that any attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules would likely provide guidance on quality control for assurance providers. 1390 1386 See supra note 1340 and accompanying text. 1387 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.2. 1388 See IAASB ISAE 3000.3(b) (Revised) (“The practitioner who is performing the engagement is a member of a firm that is su bject to [International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1], or other professional requirements, or requirements in law or regulation, regarding the firm’s responsibility for its system of quality control, that are at least as demanding as ISQC 1.”). 1389 See letter from ERM CVS.

To the extent that the registrant’s auditor is engaged to provide an attestation report in connection with the registrant’s GHG emissions, or with respect to any other climate -related disclosures, the auditor would be required to comply with applicable, existing pre -approval requirements. 1391 Even in circumstances where the GHG emissions attestatio n services are not subject to a pre- approval requirement, however, audit committees should consider what level of involvement would be appropriate for them to take with respect to the selection and retention of attestation providers for climate -related dis closures. In addition, in response to commenters’ feedback, 1392 we are amending Rule 436 to provide that a report by a n attestation provider covering Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statement s made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. 1393 We determined to include this amendment, in part, because we agree with commenters that the potential for s ection 11 liability could deter or reduce the number of a ttestation provider s willing to accept these 1391 See 15 U.S.C. 78j -1(i). See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant’s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered “Audit -Related Fees” for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 16C of Form 20 -F, or any similar requirements). 1392 See supra note 1344 and accompanying text. 1393 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1).\n",

We think t here could be reluctance on the part of a GHG emissions attestation provider to perform attestation engagements at the limited assurance level because of their potential liability under s ection 11, and that, alternatively, if GHG emissions attestation prov iders perform significantly expanded procedures, much closer to reasonable assurance, in order to meet potential liability concerns under s ection 11, substantial increased costs to issuers could result. 1395 The same considerations do not apply to reasonable assurance engagements , and we are therefore not providing a similar exception for those engagements . The amendment to Rule 436 also states that a report covering Scope 3 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority t o the statements made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. 1396 Although no registrants are required to disclose Scope 3 emissions or obtain an attestation report for Scope 3 emissions under the final rules, we have included Scope 3 emissions within the exception contained in Rule 436 in the event that a registrant voluntarily discloses its Scope 3 emissions. We believe it is appropriate to provide these accommodations to encourage registrants to obtain limited assurance over Scope 3 disclosure . 1394 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text. 1395 The Commission relied upon a similar rationale when it amended Rule 436 to provide that a report prepared or certified by an accountant within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act shall not include a report by an independent accountant on a review of unaudited interim financial statements. See Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information Under Securities Act of 1933, Release No. 33 -6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601, 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980)]. 1396 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1).\n",

Therefore, in these particular circumstances, we believe it is appropriate to provide these accommodations. One result of the amendments to Rule 436 is that a GHG emis sions attestation provider that has performed an attestation engagement over GHG emissions at a limited assurance level is not required to submit a consent in connection with the registration statement under s ection 7 of the Securities Act. 1399 However, we think it is nonetheless important that a GHG emissions attestation provider have some awareness about whether its attestation report is included in a 1397 In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level . This could reduce the incentives for GHG emissions attestation providers to perform a thorough analysis and ensure that their attestation report, which is required to be included in a registration statement with GHG emissions disclosures to which the assurance services relate, i s true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading . We remind registrants and providers , however, that there are other remedies available to shareholders and /or the Commission, such as s ection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b- 5 thereunder and section 17(a) of the Securities Act , which are not affected by the amendments to Rule 436. 1398 See supra note 1395. 1399 See 15 U.S.C. 77g.

This requirement is modeled on the requirement for an issuer to file as an exhibit to a registration statement a letter from the independent public accountant, which acknowledges their awareness that their report on unaudited interim financial information is being included in a registration statement. See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(15); Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information Under Securities Act of 1933, Re lease No. 33 -6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601 , 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980) ]; Amendments Regarding Exhibit Requirements , Release No. 6230 (Sept. 5, 1980) [45 FR 58822, 58824 (Sept. 5, 1980)] . Although the Commission did not solicit comment specifically on the requirement to provide an acknowledgement letter, the requirement follows from similar contexts noted above. In addition, the associated burdens on issuers are less than the proposed c onsent requirement while retaining the benefit of providing notice to the assurance provider. Further, to help facilitate registrants’ compliance with the requirement to file the letter from the GHG emissions attestation provider as an exhibit, we have included an instruction to Item 1506 that directs registrants obtaining assurance at a limited assurance level to Item 601(b)(27) ( as well as to paragraph 18 of Form 20- F’s Instructions as to Exhibits , as discussed infra note 1402 and accompanying text ). 1402 See Instructions as to Exhibits 18 of Form 20- F.

This bifurcated approach to reasonable versus limited assurance engagements is consistent with the current treatment of audited financial statements and unaudited (reviewed) interim financial statements.1405 While we recognize underwriters and other non- issuer defendants subject to potential liability under section 11 may face additional due diligence costs during the transition period or where limited assurance is required,1406 we do not believe this is unduly burdensome compared to other climate -related information that will be required in a registration statement pursuant to the final rules that is not otherwise expertized. Moreover, absent a mandatory limited assurance requirement in the final rules, a registrant would nonetheless be required to disclose its GHG emissions and underwriters and other defendants subject to potential liability under s ection 11 would be faced with the same potential liability and due diligence costs with respect to those 1403 See supra note 1346 and accompanying text. 1404 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text. 1405 See infra s ection II.I.5.c discussing an additional amendment to Rule 436 in the context of a registrant’s statements pertaining to voluntary assurance received over GHG emissions disclosure. 1406 Compare 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(C) (providing underwriters and others with a defense for expertized material) with 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(A) (providing underwriters and others with a defense for non- expertized materials) .\n",

We received feedback from some commenters indicating that including such a requirement in the final rules would preclude the use of certain standards that are currently widely used by GHG emissions attestation providers with respect to voluntary assurance over GHG emissions disclosures but that are not publicly available for free. 1472 After consideration of this feedback, the final rules will require that the at testation report be provided pursuant to standards that , in addition to being developed using due process, are either (i) publicly available at no cost, or (ii) widely used for GHG emissions assurance.1473 In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that open access is an important consideration 1468 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2) . 1469 See supra note 1423 and accompanying text. 1470 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1471 See id. 1472 See supra note 1428 and accompanying text. 1473 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2).\n",

In addition, it is important to recognize the value that investors have found in the voluntary assurance services currently being provided with respect to climate and GHG emissions disclosures. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to c ontinue to use assurance standards they are already using for their voluntary disclosures, assuming that those standards meet the due process requirement. 1475 This approach will not only reduce the costs of complying with the final rules1476 but will likely b enefit investors by leveraging the experience that GHG emissions attestation providers already have with particular standards, which could lead to assurance engagements being performed with a greater level of skill initially than if GHG emissions attestation providers were required to gain expertise with an unfamiliar standard. Several commenters agreed with the Commission’s statement in the Proposing Release that the attestation standards of the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB would meet the proposed 1474 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1475 Registrants and GHG emissions attesta tion providers would also need to meet the other requirements included in the final rules relating to the level and scope of the engagement and the expertise and independence of the provider, among other requirements. 1476 See letter from Futurepast (sta ting that one benefit of having non- accounting firm attestation providers provide assurance pursuant to ISO or IAASB ISAE standards is that it would make “ available to registrants a much larger pool of potential service providers,” which “will enhance competition and likely result in lower costs to registrants”).\n",
            "page 126 : attestation standard requirements.1477 We continue to be of the view that the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB standards meet the due process requirements and are publicly available at no cost to investors. In addition, in light of our modifications to the final rules, we also believe that the ISO standards related to the attestation of GHG emissions disclosures would meet these requirements. We agree with those commenters that stated the process the ISO undertakes for the development of its standards is consistent with due pr ocess requirement included in the final rules. 1478 The ISO TC 207/SC7 is the technical committee responsible for the development of ISO 14064- 3 – Greenhouse gases – Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of greenhouse gas s tatements.1479 The committee includes members from 120 countries, each represented by the country’s national standards body, and the committee also liaises with 32 organizations who monitor standards development activities and can provide input during standards development. 1480 Members organize consultations among stakeholders in 1477 See supra note 1432 and accompanying text. The PCAOB has announced an ongoing project to evaluate its attestation standards for purposes of developing any potential recommendation to amend, consolidate or eliminate certain standards as appropriate. See PCAOB, Attestation Standards Update (Updated Sept. 26, 2022), available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/standard- setting -research -projects/attestatio n- standards -update . The AICPA included its attestation standards as an active project under consideration on its 2022- 23 strategy work plan. See AICPA, 2022 -23 ASB strategy work plan, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards /auditattest/asb/downloadabledocuments/2022 - 2023 -asb-strategy -work -plan.pdf . 1478 See supra notes 1445 and 1446 and accompanying text. 1479 See ISO/TC 207/SC7, About us, available at https://committee.is o.org/home/tc207sc7.

This leads us to the conclusion that ISO standards align with the due process requirement in the final rules. As commenters have noted, ISO standards are not available for free. The ISO standards are, however, widely used for GHG emissions assurance. For example, a recent report determined that for S&P 500 companies that voluntarily obtained assurance over their climate - related disclosures, including in many cases GHG emissions disclosures, the most common standard referenced by non- accounting firm GHG emission attestation providers was ISO 14064- 3. 1484 Specifically, the report found that ISO standards were used in connection with 196 out of a total 346 engagements.1485 This frequency of use aligns with the “ widely used” criteri a in the final rules. It is important to note that by highlighting these standards, we do not mean to imply that other standards, either those currently in existence, or those that may develop in the future, would not be suitable for use under the final rules.

            "page 128 : alternative approaches, such as providing a list of acceptable standards,1486 or requiring the use of a particular standard.1487 Although we considered these alternatives, we ultimately agreed with those commenters who stated that the Commission should take a flexible approach to the acceptable standards in recognition that more than one suitable standard exists, and others could develop in the future . 1488 The final rules (Item 1506(c)) require the form and content of the GHG emissions attestation report to follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards used, as proposed; however, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules do not prescribe minimum report requirements. 1489 The Commission expla ined in the Proposing Release that the proposed minimum components were all common elements of current assurance reports,1490 a point that was affirmed in the feedback we received from commenters.1491 We continue to expect that the attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules will generally 1486 See supra note 1430 and accompanying text. See also letter from Climate Risk Consortia (recommending that the Commission permit the use of “the standards accepted by the CDP”). 1487 See supra notes 1433 , 1435, 1437, and 1439 and accompanying text. 1488 See supra note 1428 and accompanying text. For example, in the Proposing Release, the Commission included a request for comment asking if AccountAbility’s AA 1000 Series of St andards would meet the proposed requirements for attestation standards. We received one comment that stated the final rule should be written in a way that is inclusive of all standards, including AA1000, among others, but the commenter did not provide any substantiative reasons why AA1000 would meet the proposed criteria . See letter from Climate Risk Consortia. Another commenter stated that the process for developing the AA1000 standard would not meet the proposed due process requirements . See letter from ERM CVS. Although the feedback we received from commenters was mixed, t o the extent that the AA1000 stand ard meets the criteria in the final rule, registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers would not be precluded from using it in connection with complying with the final rules . The staff of the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants about whether a particular standard meets the requirements in the final rules. 1489 See 17 CFR 229.1506(c). 1490 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that it primarily derived the proposed requirements from the AIC PA’s attestation standard (e.g., SSAE No. 18), which are largely similar to the report requirements under PCAOB AT -101 and IAASB ISAE 3410. See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1491 See supra note 279 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 129 : include all of the elements that were proposed.1492 Therefore, the benefit of including the proposed minimum requirements would be marginal , at best, and could be viewed as redundant and adding unneces sary complexity and associated burde ns to the final rules. Instead, simply requiring the attestation report to follow the form and content requirements of the attestation standard or standards should provide investors with important information about the attestation engagement in a consistent and comparable manner. Nevertheless, in light of this shift to a more principles -based approach, to the extent that a particular attestation standard does not include elements sufficiently similar to those commonly included in an assurance report, the GHG emissions attestation provider should consider including such information in its attestation report to facilitate investors’ understanding of the nature and scope of the engagement. Although some commenters suggeste d additional minimum requirements that could be included in the final rules, 1493 we decided against including any additional requirements for the same reason. A few commenters asked the Commission to clarify the level of assurance that is required for his torical periods in a registrant’s filing.1494 We are therefore clarifying that the final rules apply on a prospective basis only with disclosure for historical periods phasing in over time. Specifically, in the first year that an AF or LAF is required to provide an attestation report, such report is only required to cover the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year. To the extent the AF or LAF disclosed Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for a historical period, it would not be required to obtain an assurance report covering such historical period in the first year of the attestation rule’s applicability. However, for each 1492 See supra note 1490. See also ISO 14064- 3, §§ 6.3.2 and 9.3. 1493 See supra note 1458 and accompanying text. 1494 See, e.g. , letters from Deloitte & Touche (requesting that the Commission clarify the level of assurance that is required for historical periods); and Grant Thornton (same).\n",

In circumstances where more than one GHG emissions provider may have provided an attestation report for the different fiscal years included in the filing, a GHG emis sions attestation provider should be clear about its involvement with any historical information, including disclaiming any such involvement where applicable. 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criteria” against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be “suitable.” 1497 Suitable criteria, when followed, will result in reasonably consistent measurement or evaluation of the registrant’s disclosure that is within the scope of the engagement. 1498 Consistent with commenter feedback, Item 1505 of Regulation S -K will satisfy the suitable criteria requirements of the prevailing attestation s tandards because the proposed requirements set forth relevant, 1495 This guidance parallels similar practices in the context of the fin ancial statement audit. See, e.g. , PCAOB AS 3101, The Auditor's Report on an Audit of Financial Statements When the Auditor Expresses an Unqualified Opinion, paragraph 18h, available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing- standards/details/AS 3101. 1496 See supra note 1462 and accompanying text. 1497 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1498 Characteristics of suitable criteria include relevance, objectivity, measurability, and completeness. See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C §105.A16 and A42; AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT -C §105.A16 and .A44. In addition to relevance and completeness, the character istics of suitable criteria under IAASB ISAE 3000.A23 include reliability, neutrality and understandability. Therefore, despite the differences in the characteristics listed, the underlying concepts and objectives are consistent.\n",
            "page 131 : objective standards that call for measurable and complete disclosure of GHG emissions that would allow for a consistent evaluation of the registrant’s disclosure.1499 In addition, in response to a question from a commenter,1500 we are clarifying that a report that states the GHG emissions attestation provider is disclaiming an opinion on the GHG emissions would not constitute compliance by the AF or LAF with the requirement to obtain an attestation report over its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions under the final rules. Consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules do not require a registrant to obtain an attestation report specifically covering the effectiveness of internal control over GHG e missions disclosure. 1501 Such a report would not be required even when the GHG emissions attestation engagement is performed at a reasonable assurance level. As explained in the Proposing Release, given the current evolving state of GHG emissions reporting and assurance, existing DCP obligations and the requirement that AFs and LAFs (initially) obtain at least limited assurance of such disclosure are appropriate first steps toward enhancing the reliability of GHG emissions disclosure. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol’s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia” against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated.

Therefore, the final rules do not re quire a registrant to include an attestation report in such a section, although a registrant may choose to do so. One commenter asked the Commission to clarify whether, to the extent the Commission permits the use of standards other than those developed by the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB, the Commission should clarify “whether all practitioners should be required to consider ‘other information’ in the same way as CPAs.” 1503 The GHG emissions attestation provider must perform the engagement in accordance with t he requirements included in the attestation standard being used. We are clarifying that, to the extent an attestation standard requires an attestation provider to consider ‘other information,’ then the provider would be required to comply with such a requ irement to perform the engagement in accordance with the standard. One commenter stated that, due to the proposed phase in for the assurance requirements, an LAF or AF may be required to obtain assurance over its GHG emissions disclosures, while its consolidated public subsidiaries are not (or not yet) subject to the same level of assurance. 1504 This commenter asked the Commission to consider clarifying whether the consolidated subsidiary is expected to obtain assurance based on the requirements of its parent entit y or entities , and if not , how the assurance provider for the parent entity or entities would report the level of assurance provided over the individual compone nts of the reporting entity. 1505 In response to the specific factual scenario raised by this commenter , we are clarifying that the consolidated information included in the parent company’s Commission filing would need to 1503 See letter from KPMG. 1504 See letter from Grant Thornton. 1505 See id.\n",

This means that a subsidiary’s information that is part of the consolidated reporting of its parent company will need to be assured as part of the assurance over the parent company’s consolidated reporting even if the consolidated subsidiary itself is not subject to assurance. This is consistent with how the auditing standards over consolidated financial statements generally apply. Along similar lines, a nother commenter stated that there might be instances where a subsidiary of a registrant has a separate attestation engagement performed over its GHG emissions data to meet local statutory or jurisdictional requirements and the subsidiary might choose an attestation provider at the local level that differs from the attestation provider retained to perform the assurance required under the Commission’s rules. 1506 This commenter stated, for example, if a subsidiary’s attestation engagement was performed by a n accounting firm provider that used AICPA standards, then AICPA attestation standards would allow the provider performing the assurance required under the Commission’s rules to use the work of another practitioner; however, AICPA standards do not address the ability of a n accounting fir m provider to use the work of a non- accountant practitioner , particularly when the non- accountant uses different attestation standards. 1507 Consistent with our response above, we are c larifying that the consolidated information included in the parent company’s Commission filing would need to comply with the final rules’ requirements applicable to the parent compan y. As is the case with other new disclosure requirements, t he Commission staff is available to answer practice questions as registrants begin appl ying the final rules . 1506 See letter from Crowe. 1507 See id.\n",

Final Rules The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant’s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal.1541 To reduce the burdens on issuers that would have a risen under the proposed rules, and in response to certain commenter feedback described above, we are not adopting a requirement for registrants to disclose (1) whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance; and (2) whether the attestation provider is subject to record -keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement. However, consis tent with the proposal, the final rules (Item 1506(d)) require registrants to disclose whether the GHG emission attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, subject to certain modifications.1542 In addition, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to disclose certain information when there is a change in, and disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider as discussed in greater detail below.1543 The decision not to adopt a requirement for a registrant to disclose whether its GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required, thus re ducing the burden associated with the final rules. Although the existence of a license for a GHG emissions attestation provider that is a certified public accountant is straightforward to determine because certified public accountants and their firms must be registered with s tate boards of 1541 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). 1542 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(1). 1543 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2).\n",
            "page 135 : accountancy,1544 it may be more difficult for a registrant to determine if a non -accountant GHG emissions attestation provider holds a license. Furthermore, although accreditation and certification organizations exist for GHG emissions attestation providers that are not accountants,1545 it may be difficult for registrants and even GHG emissions attestation providers themselves to determine whether the credential conferred by such organization constitutes a “license,” or if i t is some other type of accreditation or certification. Therefore, we agree with the commenter that pointed out the “absence of a universal certification or credential” likely would make it difficult for registrants to determine whether disclosure is requ ired.1546 We decided not to require a registrant to disclose whether the attestation provider is subject to record -keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement to reduce burdens on registrants. Upon further consideration, this proposed requirement would seem to have marginal benefit to investors making investment or voting decisions while adding complexity to issuer disclosures. Instead, the final rules focus the disclosure requirements on the more s ignificant disclosure of the existence of an oversight inspection program. 1547 The proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which 1544 See, e.g. , National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, Getting a License, available at https://nasba.org/licensure/gettingacpalicen se/ (explaining the licensure process for certified public accountants and accounting firms by state boards of accountancy). 1545 See, e.g. , letter from ANSI NAB (describing itself as the “only peer recognized accreditation body operating an accreditation program for oversight of greenhouse gas (GHG) validation and verification bodies (attestation providers) in the United States .”). 1546 See letter from ABA. 1547 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d).\n",
            "page 136 : program (or programs).1548 We are adopting this requirement as proposed.1549 In response to commenters ,1550 we are clarifying, for purposes of the final rules, that we would consider a GHG emissions attestation engagement to be subject to an oversight inspection program if it is possible that the assurance services could be inspected pursuant to the oversight pro gram, even if it is not certain that the services will be inspected in a particular inspection cycle. An example of such an oversight inspection program is the AICPA’s peer review program, which includes within its scope attestation engagement s performed by a certified public accountant in accordance with AICPA standards . 1551 Commenters did not offer any examples of oversight inspection programs that would include within their scope GHG emissions attestation engagements performed by non-accountants . Even if no such programs currently exist , it is possible that they could develop in the future given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance practices . Accordingly, we continue to believe that the existence of an oversight inspection program will help inv estors better understand the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn will help them determine whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure. In addition to requiring a registr ant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program as proposed, the final rules also require a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to any 1548 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.4. 1549 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). 1550 See supra notes 1532 and 1533 and accompanying text. 1551 Under the AICPA Peer Review Program, firms that are members of the AICPA are required to have a peer review of their accounting and auditing practice once every three years in accordance with the AICPA Standards f or Performing and Reporting on Peer Reviews . The peer review is conducted by an independent evaluator, known as a peer reviewer , who reviews a sample of the firm’s work against the requirements of applicable professional standards in all material respects .

            "page 137 : oversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs ).1552 To be clear, this requirement is not limited to oversight inspection programs that include within their scope, or require the inspection of, the GHG emissions attestation engagement. Rather, the final rules require the disclosure of “any” oversight inspection program that applies to the GHG emissions attestation provider.1553 Therefore, a registrant must disclose any oversight inspection program the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to for any type of engagement (e.g., a financial statement au dit or other review).1554 This additional requirement will provide investors with a better understanding of the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider because such oversight can provide a check on a provider’s overall activities and drive improvements in the quality of their services. 1555 We considered whether to only require disclosure about the existence of oversight inspections programs from registrants who engage GHG emission attestation providers that are 1552 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). 1553 See id. 1554 Examples of such oversight inspection programs include the AICPA’s peer review program or the PCAOB’s inspection program. The AICPA’s peer review program and PCAOB’s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs that a GHG emissions attestation provider may be subject to generally; however, only the AICPA’s peer review program would include within its scope the GHG emissions attestation engagement. The PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of issuers and registered brokers and dealers and does not include attestation engagements for GHG emissions disclosure within its scope. See 15 U.S.C. 7214 (setting forth the PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction). Consistent with our explanation above, commenters did not offer any examples of oversight inspection programs that apply to non- accountant GHG emissions attestation providers . 1555 For exam ple, in the context of inspections of PCAOB -registered public accounting firms, academic literature suggests that engagement -specific PCAOB inspections may have spillover effects on non- inspected engagements. See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement Inspection Process —Preliminary Evidence, 93Acct . Rev. 53, 53-80 (2018) (concluding that “engagement - specific PCAOB inspections influence non -inspected engagements, with spillover effects detected at both partner and office level s” and that “the information communicated by the PCAOB to audit firms is applicable to non- inspected engagements”); Daniel Aobdia, The Economic Consequences of Audit Firms’ Quality Control System Deficiencies , 66 Mgmt . Sci. (2020) (concluding that “common issues identified in PCAOB inspections of individual engagements can be generalized to the entire firm, despite the PCAOB claiming its engagement selection process targets higher risk clients” and that “[PCAOB quality control] remediation also appears to p ositively influence audit quality”) .\n",
            "page 138 : not registered with the PCAOB , as suggested by some commenters.1556 However, we are concerned that requiring this disclosure only with respect to certain GHG emission attestation providers could result in confusion and believe that requiring registrants to provide such disclosure with r espect to all GHG emissions attestation providers will enhance the consistency and comparability of disclosures. Moreover, to the extent that a particular GHG emissions attestation provider is registered with the PCAOB, we would not expect it to be time c onsuming or difficult for a registrant to make this disclosure, which would presumably remain the same from year -to-year absent any changes to PCAOB rules. We also considered whether to require such disclosure to be included in the attestation report as recommended by one commenter, 1557 instead of requiring the registrant to disclose this information in the filing that includes the attestation report as proposed. We understand that whether the attestation provider is subject to any oversight inspection pr ogram is in the first instance known by the attestation provider rather than the registrant, and therefore it may seem reasonable to require the attestation provider to make the disclosure rather than the registrant. However, we do not expect it would be difficult or burdensome for a registrant to obtain this information from the GHG emissions attestation provider, and in fact, we expect that most registrants would want to know about the existence of an oversight inspection program before retaining an atte station provider in most instances and therefore likely will already have such information in their possession. Moreover, we continue to believe that requiring such disclosure to be included in the attestation report may create confusion because this disc losure may not be required by existing attestation standards. 1556 See supra note 400 and accompanying text. 1557 See supra note 402 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 139 : As stated above, the Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing Release asking if it should require disclosure when there is a change in, or disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider that is similar to the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K.1558 The commenters that responded to the request for comment generally agreed with including such a requirement in the final rules.1559 Because we believe that requiring the disclosure of information regarding changes in, and disagreements with, a GHG emissions attestation provider would provide investors with important information about the provider and the conduct of the attestation engagement, which investors need to help them assess the reliability of the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures, we have included a provision in the final rules that will require AFs and LAFs subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose certain inf ormation when the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider resigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re -appointment after completion of the attestation engagement) or is dismissed. 1560 We have generally modeled this aspect of the final ru les on the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K, tailored to fit the context of a GHG emissions attestation engagement and to limit additional burdens.1561 In particular, our decision to require the disclosure in the filing that contains the GHG emissions disclosures and attestation report (e.g., a registration statement or an annual report that requires disclosure pursuant to Item 1558 See Proposing Release, Section II.H.2. 1559 See supra note 1539 and accompanying text. 1560 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(2). 1561 Although we have generally modeled these aspects of the final rules on existing requirements , in addition to the substantive differences discussed herein, we have also made several non -substantive changes and updates for readability. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the final rules nor this discussion should be construed as a modification or i nterpretation of the existing requirements on which they were modeled.\n",
            "page 140 : 1506), instead of an altern ative such as requiring a registrant to provide the disclosure in a Form 8-K, should serve to limit additional burdens associated with this provision. We believe that requiring similar disclosure for GHG emissions attestation providers to be included in t he annual report or registration statement that contains the attestation report is appropriate because it will provide investors with the essential information they need to evaluate the assurance services provided while minimizing the need for additional f ilings by a registrant. Specifically, the final rules (Item 1506(d)(2)) will require an AF or LAF subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose whether its former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned or was dismissed and the date thereof . 1562 If so, the regis trant must state whether during the performance of the attestation engagement for the fiscal year covered by the attestation report there were any disagreements with the former GHG emissions attestation provider over any measurement or disclosure of GHG em ission or attestation scope of procedures.1563 The final rules will require the registrant to describe each such disagreement and state whether the registrant has authorized the former GHG emissions attestation provider to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor GHG emissions attestation provider concerning the subject matter of each such disagreement. 1564 Like the other elements of the disclosure requirement, this is modeled on the requirement to disclose disagreements between a registrant and its independent auditor in connection with the auditor’s dismissal or resignation in Item 304 of Regulation S -K, and just as in that context, it is important that significant disagreements are brought to the 1562 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i). Therefore, the registrant w ill be required to provide disclosure in circumstances where: (1) a GHG emissions attestation provider resigns or is dismiss ed during the fiscal year covered by the attestation report but it does not issue the attestation report; and (2) a GHG emissions attestation provider issues an opinion or conclusion on GHG emissions disclosure for the relevant fiscal year but is dismissed or resigns before the attestation report is filed. 1563 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i)(B). 1564 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i)(B)(1) -(2).\n",

The final rules also include two instructions defining the term “disagreements” for purposes of the disclosure and explaining the circumstances in which it is sufficient to conclude that a disagreement has been communicated to the registrant. 1566 This definition and explanation is consistent with Item 304 of Regulation S -K and its Instructions , with minor modifications to take into account the circumstances of a GHG emissions attestation engagement.1567 We have determined to take an incremental approach to requiring disclosure about the resignation or dismissal of a GHG emissions attestation provider and therefore have not included a requirement for the registrant to request the former GHG emissions attes tation provider to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the registrant with respect to the resignation or dismissal and disagreement (if applicable). The final rules, howeve r, do not preclude a registrant from disclosing its explanation of the dismissal or resignation to its former GHG emissions attestation provider, and although not required, we encourage any GHG emissions attestation provider to convey concerns it has with the registrant’s description of those events to the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant. 1565 See Registrants and Independent Accountants Amended Rules for Increased Disclosure of Relationships , Release No. 33 -5550 (Dec. 20, 1974) [40 FR 1010, 1011 (Jan. 6, 1975)] . 1566 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(ii) -(iii). 1567 See 17 CFR 229.304(a)(1)(iv); and Instructions 4 and 5 to Item 304.\n",

It does not apply if an AF or LAF i s not required to disclose its GHG emissions (and therefore is not required to obtain an attestation report) because the AF or LAF determines that its GHG emissions are not material for a particular fiscal year. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, It em 1506(d)(2) does not apply to registrants that voluntarily obtain assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure and provide certain information about the engagement pursuant to Item 1506(e). We expect that the documentation regarding resignations and di smissals and any disagreements between the registrant and the GHG emissions attestation provider will be readily available to the registrant such that it would not be difficult or costly to comply with this requirement. 5. Disclosure of Voluntary Assurance (Item 1506(e)) a. Proposed Rules The Commission proposed to require a registrant that was not required to include a GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed rules to disclose certain information if the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures were v oluntarily subjected to third- party attestation or verification. 1568 Specifically, the Commission proposed new Item 1505(e) of Regulation S -K to require a registrant to disclose within the separately capt ioned “Climate -Related Disclosure” section in the filing the following information if the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third -party attestation or verification: (i) Identify the provider of such assurance or verification; (ii) Describe the assurance or verification standard used; 1568 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.5.\n",

Final Rule s Because the final rules will not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions from any registrant,1673 we are not adopting a safe harbor for such disclosures in the final rules. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3 emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute “forward -looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : • 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); • 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); • 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and • 17 CFR 229.1504 (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro m CEMEX. 1672 See letter from AXPC. 1673 See supra s ection II.H.3. 1674 See supra note 1639 and accompanying text. 1675 See 17 CFR 229. 1507(a)(1).\n",

When proposing the climate disclosure rules, the Commission indicated that, because transition planning, scenario analysis, and internal carbon pricing involve assumptions, judgments, and predictions about future events, the PSLRA safe harbors would be applicable to forward -looking statements concerning transition plans, scenario analysis , and internal carbon pricing. 1676 Moreover, because the proposed targets and goals disclosure provision would require a registrant to disclose how it intends to achieve its climate -related targets or goals, the Commission similarly stated that the PSLRA sa fe harbors would apply to forward -looking statements made in the context of such targets and goals disclosure.1677 Because estimates and assumptions based on future events are intrinsically involved in disclosures concerning a registrant’s transition plan, use of scenario analysis or internal carbon pricing, and targets and goals, we continue to believe that such disclosures constitute “forward- looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors. The PSLRA statutory provisions define “forward -looking statement” to include a number of different types of statements.1678 Several of these definitional provisions are potentially applicable to statements made in the context of disclosures regarding transition plans, scenario analysis, and internal carbon pri cing made pursuant to Item 1502 and regarding targets and goals made pursuant to Item 1504.

For example, a statement of potential capital expenditures made in response to Item 1502(e) (transition plans) and Item 1502(d) (narrative discussion of material impacts of climate -related risks ) would likely constitute a forward -looking statement. 1680 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1)( B) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(i)(1)(B ). For example, a statement of plans to transiti on to more efficient operations or a different mix of products or ser vices made in response to Item 1502( d), Item 1502( e), or Item 1504 (targets and goals) would likely constitute a forward- looking statement . 1681 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1)( C) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(i)(1)(C ).

Financial Statement Effect s (Article 14) 1. Introduction The Commission proposed amendments to Regulation S -X that would require certain disclosures in registrants’ financial statements. Specifically, the Commission proposed that if a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by proposed s ubpart 1500 in a f iling that also requires audited financial statements, then the registrant would be required to disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated financial statement metrics.1704 The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: • Financial Impact Metrics;1705 • Expenditure Metrics; and • Financial Estimates and Assumptions.1706 The proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required disclosure of the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions and any efforts to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on the line items in a registrant’s financial 1703 See supra note 1664 and accompanying text. 1704 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. 1705 The Proposing Release and the proposed rules used the term “metrics” to describe the proposed Regulation S-X amendments, including the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics. See Proposing Release, s ection II.F. The final rules do not use the term “metrics” to describe the Regulation S -X amendments because we think it is more accurate to characterize them as disclosures of financial statement effects.

Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, including those expressing significant concerns about the burdens associated with this aspect of the proposal, we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. 1939 While the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided additional transparency for investors , we were persuaded by those commenter s that stated the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would be burdensome and costly for registrants because of the updates that would be necessary to internal systems and processes. 1940 Therefore, at this time, we have chosen not to adopt these disclosures . These conc erns led us to adopt a significantly narrower set of requirements that are focused on requiring the disclosure of a discrete set of actual expenses that registrants incur and can attribute to severe weather events and other natural conditions. In line with the views of certain commenters, 1941 we expect these 1937 See letter from CFA Institute. 1938 See letter from Ceres (recommending that the Commission also consider also expanding its industry guides for mining, bank holding companies, real estate limited partnerships, and property- casualty insurance underwriters). The industry guides for oil and gas, mining, and bank and savings and loan companies have been codified by the Commission. See 17 CFR 229.1201 through 1208 (oil and gas); 17 CFR 229.1300 through 1305 (mining); and 17 CFR 229.1401 through 1406 (bank and savings and loan). 1939 As discussed in greater detail below, since we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, a registrant will not have the option to disclose the impact of any climate -related opportunities on the Financial Impact Metrics. See infra s ection II.K.5.c. For the same reason, we are not adopting the requirement set forth in proposed Rule 14- 02(i) requiring a registrant to include the impacts of any climate - related risks identified pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on the Financial Impact Metrics. 1940 See supra note 1791 and accompanying text. 1941 See supra notes 1924 and 1926 and accompanying text.\n",

Moreover, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s,1942 the requirements we are adopting will provide many of the same benefits of transparency and insights that the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided, albeit without as much detail, which should reduce the burden on registrants. In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii , we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants ’ financial reporting obligations .1943 Therefore , a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics.

Below, our discussion focuses on additional issues that commenters raised with respect to the proposed Expenditure Metrics . As a result, our rationale for the final rules takes into consideration all of the commenter feedback we received on the proposed rules. 3. Expenditure Effects a. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to amend Regulation S -X to require a registrant to disclose Expenditure Metrics. As proposed, the Expenditure Metrics referred to the positive and negative impacts associated with the same severe weather events, other natural condi tions, transition activities, and identified climate -related risks as the proposed Financial Impact M etrics.1947 Registrants would have been required to separately aggregate the amounts of (i) expenditures expensed and (ii) capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented. 1948 For each of 1944 See Proposing Release, s ections II.F.2 and 3. 1945 See, e.g. , letters from B. Herron (opposing the 1% disclosure threshold generally without distinguishing between the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics); Moody’s (“[W ]e therefore suggest the Commission dispense with the one -percent rule in favor of a more principles -based approach for reporting any financial statement metrics.”); and Sens. J. Reed et al. (stating its support for the 1% disclosure threshold without dist inguishing between the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics). 1946 See supra s ection II.K.2.b.iv. 1947 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 1948 The Proposing Release explained that the se metrics are focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s), and it stated that the number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of income statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements. See id.\n",

Final Rule s i. Scope (Rule s 14- 02(c) and (d)) The proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions and related to transition activities . 1993 After consideration of the comments, we are adopting a requirement (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) to disclose expenditures expe nsed and capitalized costs with a number of changes from the proposed rules based on commenter feedback.1994 In response to the concerns identified by commenters above , we have modified the proposed requirements and are adopting final rules that require dis closures that 1989 See id. 1990 See letter from Can. Bankers. 1991 See letter from Sarasin. 1992 See, e.g., letters from J. McClellan (seeking clarification on expensed or capitalized costs partially incurred towards the climate -related events and transition activities); RSM US LLP; and Salesforce (seeking clarification around what constitutes “expenditures incurred for climate -related transition activities related to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets, infrastructure or products that are intended to reduce G HG emissions, increase energy efficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy credits), or improve other resource efficiency”). 1993 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 1994 See supra note 1720 and accompanying text.\n",

The final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters.1995 Having considered the various alternatives presented by commenters, we concluded that focusing on the disclosure of discrete expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions strikes an appropriate balance between providing investors with useful information and limiting the burdens on registrants. Under the final rules, a registra nt must disclose: (1) The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses, excluding recoveries, incurred during the fiscal year as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, and (2) The aggregate amount of capitaliz ed costs and charges, excluding recoveries, recognized during the fiscal year as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions. 1996 1995 See supra section II.K.2.b.iv. See also letter from Dell (requesting that the “Commission consider limiting Article 14 of Regulation S -X requirement s to physical impacts and related expenditures only”). 1996 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c), (d). Under the final rules, disclosure must be provided for the registrant’s most recently completed fiscal year, and to the extent previously disclosed or required to be disclosed, for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the consolidated financial statements in the filing. See 17 CFR 210.14 - 01(d). In addition, f oreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under home country GAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP (including the provisions of the final rules) as the basis for calculating and disclosing this information . Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the final rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement effects .

            "page 157 : The proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to “mitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions.”1997 Some commenters indicated that it would be feasible, and significantly less burdensome, to instead segregate and quantify discrete costs incurred due to severe weather events.1998 Requiring disclosure of expenditures related to mitigation activities would present challenges for registrants in terms of forecasting and determining their expectations about future severe weather events at the time they are making expenditure decisions. In addition, c osts and expenditures related to mitigation activities may present similar issues to transition activities , which are discussed in further detail below, because the mitigation of the risks of severe weather events may be only one of several reasons why a company makes a business decision to incur a particular expenditure. Therefore, we have decided to require registrants to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred “as a result of” severe weather events and other natural conditions . 1999 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses that will be disclosed under the final rules are already captured in a registrant’s income statement or balance sheet and measured and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP or 1997 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 1998 See, e.g. , letters from Dow ( stating that direct costs related to property damage and related repair costs as a result of extreme weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast “can easily be segregated, analyzed, and quantified within our current processes”); and Nutrien (stating that if there is a fire at one of its location s that it can attribute to a severe weather event it could “ readily identify costs associated with demolition, clean -up and rebuilding of those physical assets for disclosure” ). 1999 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c) and (d). Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics only required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to the mitigation of risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions , the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions because tho se costs would have constituted line -item impacts to a registrant’s financial statements. Therefore, the requirement to disclose co sts and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions is a subset of the information that was included in the proposal.\n",
            "page 158 : IFRS.2000 Thus , this approach will be less costly and burdensome for registrants as compared to the proposed rules . In response to commenter requests for additional clarity,2001 we are prescribing an attribution principle that registrants must use to determine whether a capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss is “as a result of” a severe weather event or other natural condition.2002 The attribution principle will also simplify the determination of the amount required to be dis closed by eliminating the need to allocate portions of costs and expenditures, which will reduce compliance costs for registrants.2003 Under the final rules, t he requirement to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions remain s subject to a one percent disclosure threshold; however, we are modifying the denominators used for the threshold and adopting de minimis thresholds that exempt disclosure of amounts that aggregate to less than $100,000 in the income statement or less than $500,000 in the balance sheet, as explained in greater detail below . 2004 In addition, under the final rules, registrants must separately disclose, as part of the required contextual information, any recoveries resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions to reflect the net 2000 See, e.g. , letter from KPMG (“We recommend that the final rule clarify that the required disclosures are indeed a disaggregation of amounts already recognized in the financial statements.”). 2001 See supra note 1912 and accompanying text. 2002 The attribution principle is discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K. 3.c.iii.

Only those line items that reflect capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, and losses fall within the scope of the disclosures, as is further illustrated below in s ection II. K.3.c.vii. For example, we do not expect that gross revenues would be impacted under the final rules . In addition, we do not believe that requir ing registrants to disclose in which line item each of the required capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented will increase the burden as compared to the proposed Expenditure Metrics because the disclosures required under the final rules are simply a disaggregation of financial statement line items. Requiring registrants to separately disclose in which line item the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented will enhance the usefulness of t he disclosures for investors by allowing them to understand the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions on a registrant ’s 2005 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f).

The proposed r ules would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks. 2008 With respect to transition activities, many commenters pointed out that registrants make business decisions, such as incurring an expenditure to purchase a piece of machinery that is more energy efficient, for multiple reasons, and as a result, a registrant’s transition activities may be inextricably intertwined with its ordinary business activities. 2009 Consequently, commenters raised concerns about registrants’ abilities to identify, attribute, and quantify the impact of transition activities on the financial statemen ts. 2010 In addition, requiring disclosure for transition activities would present challenges for registrants in terms of forecasting and determining their expectations about transition activities at the time they are making expenditure decisions. Taking the se comments into consideration, we have determined not to require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures related to general transition activities in the financial statements at this time. Although we are not adopting the broader requirement for di sclosure of transition activities in the financial statements , registrants will be required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs in the financial statements .2011 The proposed rules identified the amount of expense d or capitalized 2008 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2009 See supra note 1892 and accompanying text. 2010 See supra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text. 2011 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e).

In addition, carbon offsets and RECs that are expensed or capitalized are discrete transactions that are curr ently captured in a registrant’s income statement or balance sheet.2013 Moreover, requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs will complement the disclosures regarding carbon offsets and RECs required by the amendments to Regulation S -K that we are adopting in this release . 2014 Furthermore , although the final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks in the financial statements , the final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrants to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances as described in greater detail above,2015 which should result in the disclosure of some of the information for expenditures related to transition activities that we would have expected to be disclosed under the proposed rules , albeit outside of the financial statements. Requiring the disclosure of these expenditures outside of the financial statements and subject to materiality rather than a bright- line threshold, among other things, should mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns raised by commenters with respect 2012 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2013 There is currently a diversity in practice in accounting for carbon offsets and RECs.

Current accounting standards specify minimum presentation and disclosure requirements. Importantly, however, the FASB’s Conceptual Framework provides additional guidance for evaluating whether financial information is representationally faithful. In particular, the Conceptual Framework states “[t]o be a perfectly faithful representation, ” a depiction “would be complete, n eutral and free from error. ” The Conceptual Framework further states, “[a] complete depiction includes all information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon being depicted, including all necessary descriptions and explanations”2018 (emphasis add ed).

Under the final rules, registrants are required to disclose the aggregate amount s of (1) carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) carbon offsets and RECs capitalized , and (3) losses incurred on the capitalized carbon offsets and RECs during the fiscal year. 2021 This disclosure requirement is not subject to the one percent disclosure threshold that applies to the disclosure of severe weather events and other natural conditions . Instead, disclosure is required if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve disclosed climate -related targets or goals,2022 which is consistent with the requirement to disclose information about carbon offsets and RECs included in the amendments to Regulation S -K that we are adopting in this release and therefore will hel p limit the burden for registrants and avoid confusion for investors .2023 In addition, registrants are required to disclose the beginning and ending balances of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year.2024 The beginning a nd ending balances are currently existing information in a registrant’s 2019 See FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 – Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 1, The Objective of General Purpose Financial Reporting (As Amended) (Dec . 2021). 2020 ASC 230- 10-45-13. 2021 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e). 2022 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). 2023 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d) (requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding carbon offsets or RECs “if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve climate -related targets or goal s”).

Rather, the amendments to Regulation S -X have been narrowed to focus on severe weather events and other natural conditions and carbon offsets and RECs, which will be less burdensome for registrants.

We recognize that a number of commenters expressed support for the Expenditure Metrics as proposed, including some who stated that the proposed requirements would provide investors with important information about “long term investments in asset resiliency” or would help investors understand a registrant’s ability to meet its climate -related targets and goals. 2030 Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision -useful information about registrants ’ capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions , which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants . ii.

Although we did not receive commenter feedback specifically objecting to the denominators for the proposed Expenditure Metrics (i.e., “total expend iture expensed” or “total capitalized costs”) , we have decided to use these alternative denominators because income or loss before income tax expense or benefit and stockholders’ equity or deficit are well known and understood by registrants and investors and are easily calculable based on line items in the financial statements that are defined under U.S. GAAP and IFRS .2037 These alternative denominators are broadly responsive to commenters who raised concerns that the proposed rules would be inconsistent wi th existing GAAP 2038 or would not result in comparable disclosure,2039 although neither of these concerns was specifically directed at the proposed denominators for the disclosure threshold. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. GAAP includes presentation and disclosure requirements that result in information sufficient to calculate income or loss before income tax expense or benefit , and registrants often do present this amount . In addition, while IFRS does not explicitly require income or lo ss before income tax expense or benefit , the standards do require disclosure of profit or loss and income tax expense . 2038 See supra note 1797 and accompanying text. 2039 See supra note 1793 and accompanying text.\n",

Likewise, s tockholders ’ equity or deficit represents shareholders ’ interest in the book value of an entity, and requiring a registrant to disclose the capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions will help investors understand the impact these events and conditions have on assets attributable to shareholders. The final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the absolute values of the relevant denominator. 2041 We think it is appropriate to use the absolute values because the balances for these line items may represent debit or credit balances (which are not inherently either positive or negative) in the books and records , and thus using an absolute value will avoid any confusion that could arise from using a negative number resulting from an accounting convention for the disclosure threshold.2042 2040 Some commenters raised concerns that registrants would not be able to calculate the monetary value for the 1% disclosure threshold until the end of the relevant period, which would require registrants to evaluate every transaction to determine if it counts towards the threshold . See su pra note 1814 and accompanying text. Our decision to use income or loss before income tax expense or benefit and shareholders’ equity or deficit a s the denominators in the final rules should mitigate this concern to some extent for registrants because we expect that many registrants will have insight into the magnitude of these denominators prior to the end of the fiscal year . 2041 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). 2042 Other rules in Regulation S -X use absolute values in determining whether a threshold has been exceeded.

Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics did not use absolute value s in the numerator to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold was triggered,2044 the proposed Financial Impact Metri cs did, and commenter feedback on the use of absolute values in that context was varied . A few commenters supported using the absolute value , and one investor stated that the absolute value would better reflect the significance of the impact on a registrant’s financial perform ance and position.2045 On the other hand, a few commenters objected to using the absolute value and stated it could result in the disclosure of individually immaterial information.2046 We agree with the commenter that stated using the a bsolute value to determine whether the disclosure threshold is triggered will better reflect the significance of the impact on a registrant’s financial position because the absolute value takes into account each of the relevant capitalized costs or charges (i.e., the full magnitude of the costs or charges) , whereas a net amount would not necessarily reflect the total effect on the registrant . 2043 See 17 CFR 210.14 -02(b)(2). 2044 As explained above, the proposed Expenditure Metrics did not require the disclosure of charges, and therefore there was no potential for offsetting, although charges would have been required disclosures under the proposed Financial Impact Metrics.

            "page 170 : In a further shift from the propos al, we have included de minimis thresholds in the final rules.2047 As dis cussed above, some commenters expressed the view that the proposed one percent disclosure threshold would place an unreasonable burden on smaller companies because it is more likely that the impacts on smaller companies would exceed the one percent disclos ure threshold.2048 In addition, a few commenter s mentioned a de minimis exception in their letter s.2049 We recognize the possibility that a one percent disclosure threshold could be disproportionately burdensome for smaller companies or companies in the earl y stages of developing a product or business line for which one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit or stockholders’ equity or deficit could be a very small amount . In addition to smaller companies, we think de minimis threshold s will also be helpful for companies that have income or loss before income tax expense or benefit near breakeven in a particular year, perhaps due to anomalous circumstances. Therefore, we have included in the final rules de minimis thresholds of: (1) $100,000 for expenditure s expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, and (2) $500,000 for capitalized costs and charges recognized on the balance sheet . 2050 As a practical matter, this means that, under the final rule s, registrants for which one percent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is less than $100,000 will not have to provide disclosure until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions 2047 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). 2048 See supra note 1823 and accompanying text. 2049 See letter from NAM (“The extreme burden of building new processes and systems to track quantitative climate impac ts, with no materiality threshold or even a de minimis exception for minor events or immaterial impacts, would impose colossal costs and strain resources at all public companies.”). See also letter from Cleveland Cliffs (stating a similar view). 2050 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). There is precedent in Regulation S -X for using $100,000 as a de minimis threshold. See 17 CFR 210.3- 11 (permitting a registrant to submit unaudited financial statements if gross receipts and expenditures are not in excess of $100,000).\n",

Moreover, as noted below in s ection IV , in 2022 the $100,000 de minimis value for the income statement would have exceed ed one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit for approximately 17% of registrants , and the $500,000 de minimis value for the balance sheet would have exceeded one percent of s tockholders’ equity or deficit for approximately 24% of registrants . Thus , approximately the same number of companies will benefit from the de minimis thresholds by using these values. While a number of commenters asserted that requiring disclosure at a one percent threshold would result in an excessive amount of immaterial detail for investors , the changes we 2051 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(1). For example, if a registrant had $5 million in income or loss before income tax expense or benefit for the relevant fiscal year, the registrant’s disclosure threshold for the income statement would be $ 50,000 ($5 ,000,0 00 x .01= $5 0,000). Since $50,000 falls below the $100,000 de minimis threshold, the registrant would not be required to provide the disclosure required by Rule 14- 02(b)(1) and (c) until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses equals or exceeds $100,000 (i.e., the de minimis threshold) . 2052 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2). For example, if a registrant had $2 5 million in stockholders’ equity or deficit for the relevant fiscal year, the registrant’s disclosure threshold for the balance sheet would be $ 250,000 ($25,000,000 x .01=$ 250,000). S ince $ 250,000 falls below the $500,000 de minimis threshold, the registrant would not be required to provide the disclosure required by Rule 14- 02(b)(2) and (d) until the aggregate amount of c apitalized costs and charges equals or exceeds $500,000 (i.e., the de minimis threshold) .\n",

As discussed in greater detail below, the final rules also include an attribution principle that limits the required disclos ure to circumstances where the severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant contributing factor in incurring the capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss.2054 The final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules —stockholders’ equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit — are aggregated amounts and therefore we expect that in many instances they will result in a larger denominator than what was included in the proposal. Given the narrower scope of the final rules, th e one percent threshold should not result in an excessive amount of detail or immaterial disclosure . Some commenters also raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures relative to the impacts of other risks disclosed in the financial statement s or could suggest a level of precision that does not exist.2055 However, the final rules require disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and l osses that are currently recorded in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP , and therefore the disclosures should have the same degree of precision as the other information provided in the financial statements. Moreover, the required disclosures will be in a note to the financial statements along with other 2053 See supra note 1809 and accompanying text. 2054 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(g) and infra Section II.K.3.c.iii. 2055 See supra notes 1810 and 1811 and accompanying text .\n",

Other commenters stated that applying the one percent disclosure threshold on a line -item basis could result in only partial disclosure of expenditures related to a climate -related event since the impact could be recorded in multiple financial statement line items —for which the disclosure threshold may not be triggered—which would diminish the usefulness of the information to investors.2056 Our decision not to adopt the proposed Financial Impact Metrics should alleviate this concern to a great extent . However, it remain s true that , under the final rules , the application of the disclosure threshold separately to (i) capitalized costs and charges in the balance sheet , and (ii) expenditures expensed and losses in the income statement could result in a situation where the threshold for only one of the financial statements is triggered and certain costs related to a particular severe weather event or other natural condition may not be required to be disclosed. We acknowledge that in some circumstances this may result in inves tors only receiving a partial picture of the financial statement effects of a particular event or condition ; however, applying the disclosure threshold separately to the income statement and the balance sheet will be more straightforward for registrants to implement and therefore will help to limit the overall burden of the final rules . Moreover, registrant s are not prohibited from disclosing how the severe weather event or other natural condition affected both the income statement and balance sheet, even if the disclosure threshold for one of the financial statements is not triggered. One commenter suggested that a registrant could “game” the rules by classifying costs as expenditures, rather than capitalizing costs , to avoid triggering the disclosure thr eshold. 2057 We 2056 See supra note 1813. 2057 See supra note 1991.\n",
            "page 174 : think the likelihood of this occurring is low because registrants are required to follow GAAP in determining whether to expense a cost or capitalize it and these amounts will be subject to audit . Certain commenters argued that the Commissio n should apply a different percentage threshold, such as five or ten percent.2058 Although we considered those options, in light of the other changes we are making to the disclosure threshold, such as using a n aggregated denominator and including a de minimis threshold, we think one percent will generally not result in immaterial disc losure nor result in undue burdens on registrants. In this regard, w e agree with those commenters who stated that the appropriate percentage threshold depends upon what is used as the denominator. 2059 For the same reason, we considered, but are not adopting, the other alternative disclosure thresholds that commenters suggested, such as only using a dollar threshold or requiring the disclosure of all relevant expenditures.2060 Certain commenters stated that the examples provided in the Proposing Release of oth er one percent disclosure thresholds were not analogous .2061 Generally, these commenters suggested that the examples were not analogous , at least in part, because they involved amounts that are knowable under current accounting practice and have discrete im pacts on a smaller number of larger line items (as opposed to every line item).2062 Although the alignment with 2058 See supra note s 1837 and 1838 and accompanying text . 2059 See supra note 1839 and accompanying text . 2060 See supra notes 1846 and 1848 and accompanying text. 2061 See supra note 1817. 2062 See, e.g. , letters from BHP (“Further, while we acknowledge that the Commission currently uses a specific 1% threshold for certain disclosures, we note that the disclosure examples provided by the Commission are generally narrow in scope, factual in nature and limited to certain line items in the financial statements (for example, the amount of excise taxes included in revenue)”); Ernst & Young LLP (“But we note that, unlike the climate -related impacts, excise taxes are discrete event charges that are easily calculated and tracked in a registrant’s accounting books and records.”); and IADC (“The Commission argues that a 1% quantitative threshold is used in other contexts, but the examples the Commission cites are circumstances where the quantitative amounts involved are knowable under current accounting practice, have discrete impacts on specific financial line items, and address scenarios in which more detailed disclosure is appropriate. ”).\n",

As such, as discussed above, we have significantl y modified the scope of the proposed disclosures and the proposed disclosure threshold and have included de minimis exceptions to focus the final requirements on eliciting material information for investors. We are not, however, eliminating the threshold entirely and moving to a more principles -based disclosure standard because, as discussed in the Proposing Release,2065 the proposed quantitative disclosure threshold provide s registrants with greater clarity in implementing the rules , reduces the risk of underreporting, and increases consistency and comparability . This approach is consistent with the feedback we received from some commenters that expressed concern s about the risks of underreporting in the context of the financial statements , as evidenced by the limited climate - 2063 As noted in the Proposing Release, Regulation S -X (and other aspects of the F ederal securities laws ) includ es a variety of different percentage thresholds prescribing disaggregated disclosure –rather than relying only on principles -based materiality thresholds .

Attribution Principle (Rule 14-02(g)) A number of commenters raised co ncerns about the ability of registrants to isolate, attribute, and quantify expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions. 2072 In response to these concerns, we are adopting a principle for attributing a cost, expenditure, charg e, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event or other natural condition and for determining the amount to be disclosed. The final rules ( Rule 14-02(g)) require a registrant to attribute a cost, expenditure, charge , loss, or recovery to a severe weather event or other natural condition and disclose the entire amount of the expenditure or recovery when the event or condition is a significant contributing factor in incurring the cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or recovery. 2073 Some commenters suggested that registrants should be permitted to make a reasonable estimate and disclose the assumptions that resulted in the estimate, or suggested that the 2070 See id. Notwithstanding the final rules’ 1% disclosure threshol d, registrants have a fundamental obligation not to make materially misleading statements or omissions in their disclosures and may need to provide such additional information as is necessary to keep their disclosures from being misleading.

See also Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (Aug. 12, 1999), available at https://www.sec.gov/interps/account/sab99.htm (emphasizing that a registrant or an auditor may not substitute a percentage threshold for a materiality determination that is required by applicabl e accounting principles). 2072 See supra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text . 2073 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(g).\n",
            "page 178 : Commission did not need to prescribe a particular approach to attribution or quantification because registrants already have experience allocating costs across risks when preparing financial statements. 2074 Although we considered those possibilities, we are adopting “significant contributing factor” as the attribution principle for the final rule s, which was recommended by a commenter.2075 We think it is appropriate to do so for a number of reasons. First, it is important to establish an attribution principle because allowing a registrant to apply an entity -specific methodology may not result in consistent or comparable information from one registrant to another which would limit the useful ness of the disclosures to investors. Second, the “significant contributing factor” principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor resulting in the registrant incurring the expenditure or re ceiving the recovery, while not requiring disclosure where a severe weather event or other natural condition w as only a minor factor , thereby reducing the cost burden on registrants . Moreover, many areas of U.S. GAAP currently require a registrant to apply the concept of significance (even though U.S. GAAP does not define the term “significant”) , 2076 which should help facilitate registrants’ use of this attribution principle. Although the application of this attribution principle may require the exercise of judgment, financial statement preparers are accustomed to applying judgment in many circumstan ces under U.S. GAAP , and , as stated above, preparers have experience applying the 2074 See supra notes 1913 and 1921 and accompanying text. 2075 See supra note 1918 and accompanying text. 2076 See, e.g., FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting, FASB ASC 323 Equity Method and Joint Ventures , FASB ASC 810 Consolidations , and FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement .\n",
            "page 179 : concept of significance .2077 Finally, i n addition to enhancing consistency and comparability of how the disclosures are developed , specifying an attribution and quantification principle in the final rules will reduce the burden associated with attributing (since there is no allocation involved) and quantifying costs and expenditures. iv. Recoveries (Rule 14-02(f)) In addition, the final rules ( Rule 14-02(f)) provide that, if a regi strant is required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges , or losses incurred as a result of severe weather event s and other natural conditions , then it must separately disclose the aggregate amount of any recoveries recognized during the fiscal year as a result of the severe weather events and other natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , or losses have been disclosed. 2078 Registrants would have been required to disclose the financial impact s of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including the receipt of insurance proceeds , as part of the Financial Impact Metrics included in the proposed rules. Although we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, along the lines of the proposal, t he final rules provide that any recoveries should be disclosed as part of the contextual information required by the rule s. 2079 Several commenters raised concerns about the treatment of mitigation 2077 To illustrate the application of the attribution principle, if a tornado damages the roof of a registrant’s factory and the registrant incurs costs to repair the damage, the tornado would be a significant contributing factor in incurring the costs to repair the roof and the registrant would be required to disclose the entire cost incurred (if the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered), notwithstanding the fact that if the roof had been in place for some period of time there could be other factors that contributed to the roof’s condition after the tornado. 2078 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). We expect most recoveries to consist of insurance proceeds ; however, we appreciate th at other transactions or agreements may result in recovery of amounts as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as guarantees or indemnifications, and therefore have not limited the disclosure to only insurance proceeds. 2079 See id. See infra s ection II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose contextual information.\n",
            "page 180 : efforts, such as insurance, unde r the proposed rule s.2080 Relatedly, other commenters asserted that registrants should not be permitted to use “net” amounts to determine whether disclosure is required under the rule s.2081 Having considered those comments, we are persuaded that permitting a registrant to use a net amount to determine whether capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses have exceeded the disclosure threshold would be inconsistent with the intent of the rule s because the net amount could obscure the magnitude of the financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions experienced by the registrant. For example, o btaining insurance is a risk mitigation activity that may ultimately result in payment to the registrant for costs and expenditures incurred, but it does not mean that the financial effects did not occur in the first place. T he existence of recoveries, such as insurance proceeds , is important information for investors because without it , investors could be under the misperception tha t severe weather events and other natural conditions have a greater effect on a registrant’s operations than is the case. Therefore, requiring registrants to disclose whether they have recognized any recoveries, such as insurance proceeds, as a result of the severe weather events and natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , or losses have been disclosed, will provide investors with information that is important to understand the financial statement effects of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and los ses. 2082 In addition, such disclosure w ill complement other contextual 2080 See supra note 1858 and accompanying text. 2081 See supra note 1861 and accompanying text. 2082 One commenter appeared to suggest that it would be contrary to accounting principles to require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures that are not net of insurance proceeds. See letter from Prologis. However, the final rules do not prescribe how a registrant must account for insurance proceeds in its financial statements, and registrants should prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the final rules require a registrant to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the\n",

Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of “severe weather events and other natural conditions.” 2085 Some commenters pointed out that the proposed amendments to Regulation S -K used the phrase “extreme weather events,” and that the examples of extreme weather events provided in the Proposing Release were different, but overlapping, with the examples of severe weather events included in the proposed amendments to Regulation S -X. 2086 In response to these comments and to provide greater clarity , the final amendments to Regulation S -K and Regulation financial statements and require a registrant to d isclose separately whether it has recognized any recoveries, such as insurance proceeds, as part of the contextual information that must be provided to help investors understand the financial statement effect. 2083 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). 2084 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). Under the final rules it is possible that the disclosure threshold could be triggered for a registrant’s balance sheet, but not its income statement, and vice versa, resulting in only partial disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions incurred during the fiscal year . See supra section II.K.3.c.ii. The final rules require a registrant to disclose the aggregate amount of any recoveri es recognized during the fiscal year as a result of the severe weather events and other natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , or losses have been disclosed . See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). We acknowledge that in some ci rcumstances this may result in a registrant only disclosing a portion of its expenditures corresponding to the event or condition that resulted in the recovery, which could create the impression that a registrant’s recoveries for a particular fiscal year exceed its expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions. However, as explained above, to the extent this is a concern for an issuer, there is nothing in the final rules that would prevent a registrant from disclosing how the severe weather event or other natural condition affected both the income statement and balance sheet, even if the disclosure threshold for one of the financial statements is not triggered.

However , in response to questions raised by commenters,2089 we are clarifying that a registrant is not required to make a determination that a severe weather event or other natural condition was, in fact, caused by climate change in order to trigger the disclosure required by Rule 14-02 related to such event or condition. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining “physical risks” to include “acute risks” (including severe weather events) and “chronic risks”); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). Although we do not believe there was any confusion about thi s issue, for the avoidance of doubt, we are confirming that “severe” modifies both the weather events and other natural conditions. See 17 CFR 210. 14-02(c), (d), and (h). 2088 See 17 CFR 229.1500; and 17 CFR 210.14 -02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as examples of “chronic risks .” These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to Regulation S -K. See 17 CFR 229.1500. As noted above, the final amendments to Regulation S -X include hurricanes and tornadoes as examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions, in addition to the following examples that were included in the proposed amendments to Regulation S -X and remain unchanged in the final rules : flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise. We have retained the “extreme temperatures” terminology in the final amendments to Regulation S -X instead of using the “sustained higher temperatures” terminology included in the final amendments to Regulation S -K because we want to emphasize that disclosure under Rule 14- 02 is only required if the weather event or other natural condition is “severe.” 2089 See supra note 1873 and accompanying text.\n",

We expect that the final rules will elicit disclosure appropriately a ligned with the corresponding risk- based Regulation S -K disclosure without presenting the financial - statement specific challenges associated with making a determination about whether particular events relat e to climate or climate change. The list of examp les of severe weather events and other natural conditions included in Rule 14- 02 is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive , nor are the examples intended to create a presumption about whether disclosure is required for those events in every circumstanc e. 2092 Rather, u nder the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to determine what constitutes a 2090 Similarly, a few commenter s raised concerns about determining the cause of a wildfire, see supra note 1886 and accompanying text , but as we have stated, registrants will not be required to determine the cause of the severe weather event or natural condition for purposes of providing disclosure under Rule 14- 02. The cause of a severe weather event or natural condition is irrelevant in determining whether disclosure is required under Rules 14- 01 and 14- 02. 2091 For example , the “natural conditions ” referenced in Rule 14- 02 need not be climate -related, and therefo re may include types of non- climate -related occurrences, such as earthquakes, if severe and depending on the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances. See letter from Chamber. In addition to simplifying the analysis for registrants, as discussed below, disclosure of these non- climate -related severe weather events and other natural conditions is consistent with the other event -based disclosure reflected in the final amendments to Regulation S -X and will elicit material information for investors. 2092 We believe providing examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions will aid in the comparability of the resulting disclosure while assisting issuers in making the disclosures.

We do not agree with those commenters who suggested that we should provide a comprehensive list of severe weather even ts, or refer to a list from another source, because doing so would be inconsistent with the dynamic nature of these events. 2094 Furthermore, a particular weather event may be “severe” in one region but not in another region. We considered whether the non- exclusive list of examples should be expanded to include other types of severe weather events or other natural conditions identified by commenters in their comment letters;2095 however, we designed the list as non- exhaustive and non -exclusive because we thin k it is more appropriate to take a flexible approach to enable registrants to exercise judgment in identifying severe weather events or other natural conditions based on the impacts those events have on their financial condition . Some commenters asserted that allowing registrants to exercise judgment about which severe weather events or natural conditions to analyze would reduce comparability.2096 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant to every 2093 For exa mple, in determining whether high temperatures constitute a severe natural condition, a relevant factor may include average seasonal temperatures. 2094 See supra notes 1867 and 1870 and accompanying text. 2095 See, e.g. , letters from Anthesis (cyclones, water stress, severe participation, and severe wind); Chamber (earthquakes); Climate Advisers (deforestation); and WSP (water stress). 2096 See supra note 1872 and accompanying text.\n",

We expect that the final rules w ill give registrants the flexibility to adopt reasonable approaches to identifying severe weather events and other natural conditions and adapt to changing circumstances. As a result, the final rules provide a level of fl exibility that even a regularly updated, prescribed list of events would be unable to match —resulting in what we believe is appropriate, decision- useful information to investors. Some commenters raised questions about how to identify the beginning and ending dates of severe weather events and how to disclose weather events where the impact from the weather event may continue into the future. 2097 We have streamlined the final rules to focus on requiring the disclosure of expenditures for specific transactions that are recorded in a regist rant’s books and records during the fiscal year , and that are attributable to severe weather events or other natural conditions. T his more straightforward approach will make it clearer when disclosure is required and avoid many of the questions raised by commenters in this regard . vi. Carbon Offsets and Renewable Energy Credits (Rule 14-02(e)) If carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s pla n to achieve its disclosed climate -related targets or goals, the final rules ( Rule 14-02(e)) require registrants to disclose (1) the aggregate amount of carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) the aggregate amount of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs recognized , and (3) the aggregate amount of losses 2098 incurred on the capitalized carbon offsets and RECs, during the fiscal 2097 See supra notes 1881 and 1882 and accompanying text . 2098 For example, an impairment could result in the recognition of a loss on a capitalized carbon offset .\n",

This commenter was referring generally to the Commission’s proposal to amend both Regulation S -K and Regulation S -X when it stated its support for anchoring disclosure s required outside the financial statements to disclosures required inside the financial statements and was not directly addressing the requirement to disclose expenditure related to carbon offsets or RECs .

Specifically, while the disclosure of expenditures related to the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs will provide information about the registrant’s activity throughout the fiscal period, it does not provide information about the carbon offsets still available to the registrant for use in future periods , which some commenters indicated is important information. 2107 The requirement to provide the beginning and ending balances will help provide a more complete picture of the financial impact of a r egistrant ’s use of carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed target or goal. While this particular data point was not part of the 2105 See letter from J. McClellan (stating that a registrant’s intent to meet its climate -related targets or goals through any purchase of offsets or RECs “is directly connected to climate related financial metrics” and “[t]here is consensus that significant capital expenditures will be required to meet the most ambitious targets, a nd investors will want to understand how a registrant is deploying capital against its target .”). 2106 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). 2107 See, e.g., letters from Rockefeller Asset Mgmt.

Respondents provided feedback on this project indicating that the lack of guidance in GAAP for accounting for r egulatory credits results in a significant diversity in practice.

Assume a registrant (1) capitalized $1,200,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event A; (2) incurred an impairment charge of $750,000 in the income statement to write -off $750,000 of inventory from the balance sheet related to Natural Condition B; (3) capitalized $1,000,000 of expenditures to replace the inventory written off related to Natural Condition B; ( 4) expensed $2,000,000 of expendit ures related to Severe Weather Event C; and ( 5) received $400,000 in insurance recoveries related to Severe Weather Event A. The registrant determined that Severe Weather Events A and C and Natural Condition B were significant contributing factors in incurring the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and recovery describe d above. In addition, the registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate -related target or goal , and it capitalized $1,000,000 and expensed $3,000,000 of carbon offsets or RECs during the period.

The registrant would determine whether the financial statement effects as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the thresholds, as illustrated below: Expenditure Category Current Fiscal Year Balances (Stockholders’ Equity from Balance Sheet, Income or Loss Before Income Tax Expense or Benefit from Income Statement) Severe Weather Event A Natural Condition B Severe Weather Event C Percentage Impact Balance Sheet (capitalized costs and charges) $150,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,750,000 1.97% Income Statement (expenditures expensed as incurred and losses) $75,000,000 $750,000 $2,000,000 3.67% In the above example, the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event A was $1,200,000 (capitalized on balance sheet), the capitalized cost, charge, and loss incurred as a result of Natural Condition B was $1,750,000 (charge on balance sheet and loss in income statement of $750,00 and capitalized cost of $1,000,000 on the balance sheet), and the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event C was $2,000,000 (expense in the income statement). The aggregate amount of the absolute value of capitalized costs an d charges on the balance sheet ($ 2,950,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of stockholders’ equity, and therefore disclosure would be required for these costs and charges. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit , and therefore disclosure would be required for the expenses and loss.

In response to a question raised by a commenter, with respect to the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions , we are clarifying that the final rules do not require a registrant to disclose both the capitalization of expenditures and subsequent expense of expenditures in the same period. See supra note 1989. Rather, the final rules require the disclosure of expenditures expensed and losses “ as incurred. ” See 17 CFR 210.14 -02(c). For example, a registrant that purchased new machinery to replace machinery that was damaged due to a severe weather event would be required to disclose the cost to purchase the new machinery (assuming the relevant disclosure threshold is met), but the registrant would not be required to disclose (or include in the numerator for purposes of calculating the disclosure threshold) the subsequent depreciation associated with the machinery. 2121 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(d).\n",

Final Rule s We are adopting the proposed requirements ( Rule 14-02(h)) for registrants to disclose impacts on financial estimates and assumptions with some modifications.2165 First, the Commission proposed to require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the consolida ted financial statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a potential transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate related targets disclosed by the registrant. 2166 The final rules, instead of requiring disclosures related to “a potential transition to a lower carbon economy,” require registrants to disclose financial estimates and assumptions related to a narrower category of transition activities, specifically, “any . . . transition plans disclosed by t he registrant.”2167 As noted above, commenters, including registrants, raised concerns about the scope of transition activities and potential difficulties with identifying and quantifying their impacts when they overlapped with a registrant’s ordinary business decisions. 2168 To reduce the potential burden on registrants, we have decided to narrow the scope of transition activities covered by this aspect of the final rule to only those transition plans disclosed by the registrant. 2169 Consistent with the 2164 See letter from BHP . 2165 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h) . 2166 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. 2167 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). 2168 See supra note 1892 and accompanying text. 2169 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h).\n",

The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from , severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. 2174 2170 See id. 2171 See supra notes 2138 -2141 and accompanying text. 2172 We have added hurricanes and tornadoes to the list of severe weather events and other natural conditions included in Rule 14- 02(h) to be consistent with the addition of these two types of severe weather events or natural conditions in Rule 14 -02(c) and (d). See supra section II.K.3.c.v. 2173 See 17 CFR 2 10.14- 02(h). As previously discussed, the final rules include similar requirements under subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K to disclose material impacts on financial estimates and assumpt ions as a direct result of disclosed actions under a transition plan or as a direct result of a disclosed target or goal or actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal . See 17 CFR 229.1502(e) , discussed supra section II.D .2, and 17 CFR 229.1504(c )(2), discussed supra section II .G.3. When responding to these Regulation S -K provisions, a registrant may cross -reference from the disclosure provided under 17 CFR 210 .14-02(h) to the extent such disclosure is responsive to the se subpart 1500 provisions. 2174 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). For the avoidance of doubt, if the registrant’s estimates and assumptions were not materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions , or any climate- relate d targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant, then no disclosure is required under Rule 14- 02(h).\n",
            "page 197 : As described above, a number of commenters indicated that if we adopted a requirement to disclose impacts on estimates and assumptions , then it would be appropriate to include a materiality qualifier in the final rule s, and those commenters recommended various permutations related to the materiality qualifier.2175 After considering this feedback, w e have modified the final rules to focus on estimates and assumptions that have been materially impacted because a registrant may use num erous inputs and assumptions, including qualitative considerations, when developing accounting estimates. F ocusing on estimates and assumptions that were materially impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets and plans w ill help to reduce operational challenges and burdens that could arise if registrants were required to assess all impacts when determining the disclosures that would be required. We considered whether it would be appropriate to in stead include two materiality qualifiers and r equire the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions that were materially impacted. However, we think that adding a second materiality qualifier is unnecessary because the disclosures that would result from the two different alternatives would like ly be the same. Namely, w e think it is unlikely that there could be “material ” impact to an estimate or assumption if the estimate or assumption itself was not material to the financial statements .2176 We also consider ed whether to require disclosure of any impacts to material estimates and assumptions or to not include any materiality qualifiers in the final rules, but we think the approach we are taking appropriately balances investors’ need for decision- useful informat ion with a desire to reduce operational challenges for registrants. 2175 See supra notes 2138 -2141 and accompanying text. 2176 See supra note 381 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 198 : We continue to believe that disclosure of whether and how climate- related events impacted the development of financial estimates and assumptions w ill provide important information to investors. As the Commission stated in the Proposing Release, such disclosure will provide insight into the impacts described above on the registrant’s financial statements and will allow investors to assess the reasonableness of the registrant’s estimates and assumptions . 2177 Among other things, these disclosures will allow investors to evaluate material impacts on future cash flows, which will help investors make more informed investing decisions. We also agree with those commenters that stated disclosure o f impacts on financial estimates and assumptions would enable investors to evaluate a registrant’s “physical risk resilience,” 2178 or would inform investors “of the scope, likelihood, and magnitude of potential risks as perceived by the company” and enable “ comparative analysis against peers.” 2179 Some commenters stated that they did not support the proposed requirement to disclose financial estimates and assumptions because existing accounting standards already require the disclosure of this information and therefore this additional requirement would be unnecessary or could be confusing for investors. 2180 Although we agree with commenters that U.S. GAAP and IFRS require the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions in many circumstances,2181 including significant inputs associated with material estimates and assumptions, the final rules will enhance transparency and consistency by requiring registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed 2177 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. 2178 See letter from Morningstar. 2179 See letter from BMO Global. 2180 See supra notes 2145 and 2146 and accompanying text. 2181 See supra note 2145.\n",

In addition, although we agree with commenters that the proposed requirements share similarities with critical accounting estimates,2182 we do not think those disclosures obviate the need for this requirement because the final rules go further by requiring specific disclosure about how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. W hile critical accounting estimates are often presented outside of the financial statements, the disclosure regarding material impacts to estimates and assumptions will be located in a single note to the financial statements along with the other financial statement disclosures we are adopting, which will enhance the usefulness of the disclosure to investors . Furthermore, w e do not think the requir ed disclosure will be confusing to investors . To the contrary, it will provide investors with more decision -useful information about the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements than is required under applicable accounting standa rds. Registrants are presumably making business decisions and taking actions to achieve their disclosed transition plans and targets and t hese decisions may have material impact s on their estimates and assumptions . Providing investors with an understandi ng of these impacts will help them better evaluate a registrant ’s financial position , performance , and future cash flows . Other commenters raised concerns about registrants’ abilities to isolate the relevant impacts when there may be more than one contributing factor. 2183 We expect these concerns to be mitigated to some extent by the final 2182 See supra notes 2153 and 2154 and accompanying text. 2183 See supra note 2150 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 200 : rules, which include a materiality q ualifier and thereby focus management on a narrower category of impacts for which management should have greater insight . In addition, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of the impacts , which general ly is less burdens ome to produce than if management had to identify a specific amount. In addition, we are reiterating a few examples that were included in the Proposing Release where severe weather events, natural conditions, or a registrant’s disclosed targets or transition plans could affect a registrant’s financial estimates and assumptions.2184 For example, a registrant’s climate -related targets and related commitments, such as a disclosed commitment to achieve net -zero emissions by 2040, may impact certain accounting e stimates and assumptions. Also, for example, if a registrant disclosed a commitment that would require decommissioning an asset by a target year, then the registrant’s useful life and salvage value estimates used to compute depreciation expense as well as its measurement of asset retirement obligation should reflect alignment with that commitment. Financial statement estimates and assumptions that may require disclosure pursuant to the final rules may include those related to the estimated salvage value o f certain assets, estimated useful life of certain assets, projected financial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss contingencies, estimated reserves (such as environmental reserves , asset retirement obligations, or loan loss allowances), estimated credit risks, fair value measurement of certain assets, and commodity price assumptions. Finally, a lthough we considered whether it would be appropriate to require disclosure of material changes in estimates, assumptions, or methodology a mong fiscal years and the reasons 2184 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4.\n",
            "page 201 : for those changes ,2185 at this time we are not including such a requirement in the final rules. T he narrower scope of the final rules, which is focused on discrete transactions that are currently recognized in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP, reduces the need for explicit requirements regarding material changes in estimates and assumptions underlying the financial disclosures . Current requirements under GAAP would continue to apply to material changes in estimates and assumptions. 2186 In addition, in response to the commenter that asked for clarification about whether foreign private issuers would have to provide interim updates,2187 we are clarifying that the final rules will not af fect existing filing obligations under Form 6 -K. 5. Opportunities a. Proposed Rule s The proposed rule s would have permitted a registrant , at its option, to disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate -related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K, on any of the financial statement metrics.2188 The Proposing Release explained that if a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the impact of a climate -related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so consistently ( e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the 2185 See supra note 2157 and accompanying text. 2186 See FASB ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections and IFRS IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 2187 See supra note 2164 and accompanying text. 2188 See Proposing Release, s ections II.F.2, 3, and 4.\n",
            "page 202 : opportunities and triggering the threshold.2212 One commenter requested that the Commission provide additional guidance around the definition of climate -related opportunities.2213 c. Final Rule s In light of the changes to other aspects of the final rules , we have decided not to adopt the proposed rules related to the disclosure of opportunities. First, a s discussed above, we have decided not to adopt: (1) the proposed Financial Impact M etrics,2214 (2) the proposed requirement to disclose costs and expenditures related to general transition activities in the financial statements (e.g., a portion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics) , and (3) the proposed requirement to disclose the impacts of any climate -related risks identified pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K. The proposed rules would have permitted a registrant to disclose the impact of any opportunities with respect to each of these disclosure items .2215 Because the se disclosure items will not be included in the final rules, there is no reason to adopt final r equirements regardin g the disclosure of opportunities with respect to these items . Second, as discussed above in section K.3.c , in a modification from the proposed rules, the final rules require the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events.2216 Unlike the proposed rules, t he final rules do not make a distinction between “risks” and “opportunities” in the financial statement disclosure requirements. Therefore, we do not think it is necessar y to retain a provision related 2212 See letter from Morningstar. 2213 See letter from PwC . 2214 See supra note 1735 for an explanation regarding the overlap between the proposed Financial I mpact Metrics and the proposed E xpenditure Metrics. 2215 See Proposing Release, s ections II.F.2, 3, and 4. 2216 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c) and (d). The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of costs and expenditures to “mitigate the risks from seve re weather events and other natural conditions.” See Proposing Release, section II.F.3.\n",
            "page 203 : to the disclosure of opportunities. To the extent that a registrant incurs costs and expenditures as a result of a severe weather event (applying the final rules’ attribution principle), the registrant would be required to disclose these costs and expenditures under the final rules regardless of the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met). However, we do not expect that registrants will commonly incur costs , expenditures , charges, and losses as a result of severe weather event s or other natural conditions in furtherance of an opportunity. In this regard, our expectation is consistent with the Proposing Release, which did not provide any examples of opportunities associated with severe weather e vents and other natural conditions in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics . 2217 To the extent that a registrant identifies a cost or expenditure incurred as a result of severe weather event s or other natural conditions that it believes was in curred in furtherance of an opportunity, disclosure of the cost or expenditure would be required (assuming the other requirements of the final rules are satisfied ) as explained above. However , the registrant would not be required to identify any costs or expenditures disclosed under Article 14 as related to an “opportunity” as explained in greater detail below.2218 The same analysis applies to opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. The requirement in the final rules to d isclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed 2217 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3 (stating , in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics, that a registrant may choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities but remaining silent with respect to opportunities for costs and expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions). 2218 The same analysis applies to opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. The requirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Under the final rules, a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs regardless of the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met) for the same reasons as discussed in this paragraph with respect to severe weather events . See 17 CFR 210.14 -02(e).\n",
            "page 204 : rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Under the final rules, a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RE Cs regardless of the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met) for the same reasons as discussed in the previous paragraph with respect to severe weather events . We expect that registrants will most commonly incur costs, expenditures, and losses in connection with the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs as part of a strategy to mitigate transition risk as opposed to in furtherance of an opportunity . However, to the extent that a registrant incurs such costs, expendit ures, and losses in furtherance of an opportunity, the registrant would not be required to identify any amounts disclosed under the final rules as related to an “opportunity” as explained in greater detail below. Third, as discussed above in s ection K.4, we are adopting Rule 14- 02(h), which we have modified from the proposal, to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to r isks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. 2219 After further consideration, we believe that including a pr ovision regarding the disclosure of the impact of opportunities on the financial estimates and assumptions is also unnecessary. That is because Rule 14 -02(h) requires a registrant to disclose the “known impacts” on its financial estimates and assumptions and “impacts” is not limited to 2219 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h).\n",
            "page 205 : negative impacts.2220 Nor does “known impacts” draw a distinction between the impact s resulting from “risks” or “opportunities.” In other words, to the extent that a registrant’s financial estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events or other natural conditions or disclosed targets or transition plans, the r egistrant would be required to disclose this material impact under the final rules regardless of the reason for the impact.2221 Therefore , we are not adopting the proposed rules related to the voluntary disclosure in the financial statements of the impact o f any opportunities related to financial estimates and assumptions . The approach we are taking in the final rules will mitigate many of the concerns that commenters raised about the disclosure of opportunities , while still providing investors with decisi on-useful information about a registrant’s capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and material impacts to estimates and assumptions . As discussed above, the final rules do not distinguish between “risks ” and “opportunities ” in requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and material impacts to estimates and assumptions, and registrants will not be required to identify any amounts disclosed under the final rules as related to a “risk” or “opport unity.” Furthermore, any capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and material impacts to financial estimates and assumptions required to be disclosed under the final rules are limited to those that a registrant has actually incurred and recorded in its books and records . These aspects of the final rules should alleviate commenters’ concerns about the potential for greenwashing, 2222 issues regarding 2220 See id. 2221 See id. 2222 See supra note 2197 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 206 : auditability,2223 and concerns that registr ants could be required to disclose sensitive or competitive business information related to opportunities .2224 Similarly, commenters’ concerns about the definition of “opportunities” as applied to the financial statement disclosures2225 are rendered moot because , as explained above, the final rules will not require registrants to identify particular capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, losses, or material impacts to estimates and assumptions as derived from an opportunity, and furthermore the fin al rules no longer include a definition of opportunities .2226 6. Financial Statement Disclosure Requirements a. Contextual Information (Rule 14-02(a)) and Basis of Calculation (Rule 14- 01(c)) i. Proposed Rule s In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that because the proposed financial statement metrics would involve estimation uncertainties driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other financial statement disclosures, registrants would be required to disclose conte xtual information to enable a reader to understand how it derived the financial statement metrics, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the metrics. 2227 2223 See supra note 2202 and accompanying text. 2224 See supra n ote 2193 and accompanying text. 2225 See supra note 2208 and accompanying text. 2226 See supra section II.C.1.c. 2227 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that inputs and assumptions may include the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the amount of impact on the financial statements between the climate- related events and activities an d other factors. The Proposing Release also stated that policy decisions may include a registrant’s election to disclose the impacts from climate -related opportunities. See Proposing Release, section II.F.1.\n",
            "page 207 : financial statements, one commenter sta ted that the proposed rule “makes no allowance for wholly- owned subsidiaries, which may lead to duplication and double counting.”2244 In addition, most commenters supported requiring the application of existing GAAP to the proposed financial statement metr ics.2245 However, a number of commenters raised concerns that certain of the proposed financial statement metrics would not necessarily comport with GAAP, including amounts for lost revenues, cost savings , or cost reductions.2246 In addition, in response to a question in the Proposing Release, certain commenters stated that the proposed financial statement metrics should be calculated at a reportable segment level when a registrant has more than one reportable segment, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting, or presented by geographic areas that are consistent with the registrant’s reporting pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 280- 10-50-41. 2247 On the other hand, some commenters stated that they did not support calculating and presenting the disclosures at a segment or geographic level because it would be too complex or would result in the disclosure of irrelevant information. 2248 iii. Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, we are adopting the requirement ( Rule 14-02(a)) to provide contextual information with certain clarifying modifications. We have decided to include in the text of the final rules two additional types of contextual information a registrant is required to disclose. 2249 In addition to the types of contextual information included in the 2244 See letter from PPL. 2245 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; E ni Spa; KPMG; and Mazars. 2246 See letter from Chamber. See also, e.g., letters from KPMG; PwC; SIFMA; and Soc. Corp. Gov. 2247 See, e.g., letters from Eni Spa; ICGN; Mazars; Moody’s; Morningstar; and Sarasin. 2248 See, e.g., letters from Abrasca; BHP; and SEC Professionals. 2249 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a).\n",
            "page 208 : proposed rule s, registrants will also be required to disclose significant judgments made and other information that is important to an investor’s understanding of the financial statement effect .2250 Therefore, under the final rul es, a registrant must “[p]rovide contextual information, describing how each specified financial statement effect . . . was derived, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, significant judgments made, [and] other information that is important to understand the financial statement effect and, if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the specified disclosures .”2251 Similar to the Proposing Release, in the discussion of the financial statement disclosures above , we provide d certain non- exclusive examples of the types of contextual information that registrants may be required to disclose depending on the particular f acts and circumstances. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects .2252 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting may involve estimation uncertaintie s that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, like certain other financial statement disclosures,2253 and therefore disclosure of contextual information will facilitate investors’ understanding of the financial statement effects and will be an integral part of the financial statements. 2250 See id. 2251 See id. 2252 See supra note 2232 and accompanying text. 2253 For example, the application of FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC Topic 326 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses require the application of judgment when applying GAAP to the financial statements. FASB ASC 275 -10-50-6 through 50 -15A require the disclosure of information about certain significant estimates. In addition, FASB ASC 235 -10-05-3, 05-4, and 50 -1 require the disclosure of information about accounting policies.\n",
            "page 209 : In response to certain commenters’ requests for clarification or additional guidance,2254 as noted above, we decided to include in the final rules two additional types of contextual information that will en hance investors’ understanding of the financial statement disclosures . We have decided to include “significant judgments” as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures , and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures .2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions. 2256 In addition, to enhance understanding of the financial statement disclosures , the final rules explicitly require disclosure of other information that is important to understand the financial statement effects .2257 In section II. K.3.c.iv above , we have specified one instance where the final rules require registrants to disclose this type of contextual information because we think t he information is important to understand the financial statement effects of the 2254 See supra note 2239 and accompanying text. 2255 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). Registrants are regularly required to exercise judgment when applying GAAP to prepare their financial statements and therefor e the fact that the final rules will require registrants to exercise judgment is not unusual . For example, FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires an entity to disclose significant judgments in the application of the guidance (AS C 606- 10-50-17), FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to disclose judgments and assumptions about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements, and FASB ASC Topic 842 Leases requires a lessees to disclos e information about significant assumptions and judgments made in applying the requirements of Topic 842 . 2256 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). 2257 See id.\n",
            "page 210 : disclosed capitalized costs, expenditure s expen sed, charges, or losses .2258 By requiring the disclosure of information that is important to understand the financial statement effects , the requirement to provide contextual information will also help registrants avoid having incomplete and potentially mis leading disclosures. We disagree with the commenters who stated that requiring disclosure of contextual information would result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is not useful for investors.2259 On the contrary, the requirement to provide contextual information will improve the comparability of disclosures by enabling investors to understand how registrants have exercised judgment and made assumptions in determining the financial statement effect . This will enable investors to compare judgments and assumptions made by registrants, including across industries, which w ill provide investors with useful information for purposes of their investment and voting decisions. Furthermore, although we are clarifying aspects of the contextual informat ion requirement, we disagree with the commenters who stated that the requirement to provide contextual information should be simplified and that more guidance is needed with respect to the level of detail required. 2260 The final rule s intentionally provide flexibility to registrants to allow them to include contextual information that is tailored to their particular circumstances thereby improving the usefulness for investors of the disclosures. One commenter stated that a registrant would be required to ma ke many assumptions and policy decisions to disclose contextual information. 2261 As noted above, the final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, and losses incurred 2258 See id. 2259 See supra note 2236 and accompanying text. 2260 See supra notes 2237 and 2238 and accompanying text. 2261 See supra note 2236 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 211 : as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which require fewer assumptions and policy decisions by the registrant than would have been required under the proposed rules. As a result, we expect the extent of contextual information provided under t he final rules will be reduced as compared to the proposal. We are also adopting the requirements ( Rule 14-01(c)) for registrants to calculate the financial statement effects using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the r egistrant’s consolidated financial statements and to apply the same set of accounting principles that a registrant is required to apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements, consistent with the proposal. 2262 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, requiring registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosures using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements w ill avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency, and aid comparability. 2263 In addition, we agree with the commenter who stated that applying the same set of accounting principles to the financial statement disclosures will aid comparability.2264 We are not aware of any cir cumstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP, and therefore we are striking the words “[w]henever applicable” from the final rules, in response to the commenter who stated that this phrase was confusing because it could i mply that 2262 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(c). 2263 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. As noted above, one commenter stated that the proposed rule “makes no allowance for wholly- owned subsidiaries, which may lead to duplication and double counting.” See supra note 2244 and accompanying text. Although the comment letter doe s not provide additional context for this statement, we think the commenter may have the misimpression that the proposed disclosure threshold would have been evaluated at the parent and subsidiary level separately. On the contrary, and as proposed, the fi nal rules will require registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosure using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing, which we do not believe would result in any double -counting or duplication. 2264 See supra note 2241 and accompanying text.\n",
            "page 212 : the Commission is aware of circumstances where the applicable accounting principles would be inconsistent with GAAP.2265 In addition, it is important for investors to be provided with information that is consistent across financial statements. As discussed above, the Commission also received feedback about whether registrants should be required to calculate the proposed financial statement metrics at a reportable segment level or to present the metrics by geographic areas. 2266 The Commission did not propose such requirements and —although we do not necessarily agree with those commenters that stated requiring disclosure at a segment or geographic level would be too complex or result in the disclosure of irrelevant information2267—we think the approach to disclosure we are adopting strikes an appropriate balance between providing consistent, comparable, and decision- useful information to investors and the associated burdens to registrants. Finally, several areas of commenter question or concern related to the requirements discussed above are addressed by our decision to not adopt the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and to focus on the disaggregation and disclosure of discrete transactions that are recorded in the financial statements. For example, concerns about the interaction between GAAP and the proposed Financial Impact Metrics w ill not apply to the final rules. 2268 For the sake of clarity, however, we reiterate that the rules the Commi ssion is adopting require registrants to apply existing GAAP recognition and measurement requirements to the financial statement disclosures . 2265 See supra note 2242 and accompanying text. 2266 See sup ra notes 2247 and 2248 and accompanying text. 2267 See supra note 2248 and accompanying text. 2268 See supra note 2246 and accompanying text.\n",

Final Rule s As explained above, we believe it is appropriate to require that the financial statement effects disclosure we are adopting be presented in a note to the financial statements (Rule 14- 01(a)).2355 Identifying a specific location for the disclosures – a note to the financial state ments – will make the information more accessible for investors.2356 In addition, we agree with the commenter that stated that including the disclosure of the financial statement effects in the financial statements will facilitate invest or decision- making. 2357 As is true of any disclosures included in the financial statements, s ubjecting the required disclosures to a financial statement audit and registrants’ ICFR will enhance the reliability of that information. The scope of the final rules is significantly narrower than the proposal and requires the disclosure of costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants’ books and records and material ly impacted financial estimates and assumptions. T hese modifications will ease ma ny of the burdens that registrants identified with respect to requiring the disclosures to be subject to audit and ICFR. We considered the various alternatives suggested by commenters, including whether to require the disclosure of financial stateme nt effects to be provided in supplemental information 2354 See, e.g., letters from BOA ; LTSE ; NAM ; Soc. Corp. Gov. ; and TotalEnergies . 2355 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(a). 2356 See, e.g. , letters from PGIM; and UAW Retiree. See also IAC Recommendation ( indicating its support for requiring the presentation of disclosures in the financial statements and stating “[m]aking this information available in a predictable way that is consistent with the location of other important data helps achieve the goal of consistent dissemination of this important information”). 2357 See letter from Sarasin.\n",
            "page 214 : or a schedule outside of the financial statements .2358 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting, however, present financial information that is derived from registrants’ books and records and is already included in registrants’ financial statements . Therefore, presenting this information in a note to the financial statements , consistent with other financial statement disclosures, will en hance its accessibility and usefulness for investors. We do not think it would be appropriate to exempt the se financial statement disclosures from audit or ICFR requirements . Providing an exemption from audit or ICFR for the financial statement disclosur e requirements in the final rules could confuse investors about which parts of the financial statements are covered by audit and ICFR. Nevertheless, the phase in periods provided for in the final rules should give registrants and their auditors time to fa miliarize themselves with the new requirements before the compliance date and should help to mitigate the concerns raised by commenters. With respect to auditing standards, PCAOB standards can and will apply to the financial statement disclosures inclu ded in a note to the financial statements. We understand that a number of commenters raised concerns about applying PCAOB standards and stated that additional guidance would be needed.2359 The modifications made to the final rules to narrow their scope to capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges , and losses derived from transactions and amounts recorded in registrant’s books and records underlying the financial statements and material ly impacted estimates and assumptions, along with the Commission’ s adoption of an attribution principle, will help to mitigate commenters’ concerns about the auditability of the disclosures. In light of these modifications, we expect that including the 2358 See supra notes 2306 and 2308 and accompanying text. 2359 See, e.g. , supra note 2318 and accompanying text.\n",

Several commenters raised concerns about how auditors would address the one percent disclosure threshold when considering materiality in planning and perfor ming an audit.2360 Auditors should apply the concepts of materiality in PCAOB AS 2105, Con sideration of Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit, to the rules we are adopting. In applying the concept of materiality, auditors should remain alert for misstatements that could be material due to quantitative or qualitative factors and lesser amounts of misstatement could influence the judgment of a reasonable investor because of qualitative factors. 2361 Under PCAOB Auditing Standards, auditors should also evaluate whether, in light of particular circumstances, there are certain accounts or disclosures for which there is a substantial likelihood that misstatements of lesser amounts than the materiality level established for the financial statements as a who le would influence the judgment of a reasonable investor. If so, the Auditing Standards provide that the auditor should establish separate materiality levels for those accounts or disclosures to plan the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures for those accounts or disclosures.2362 Additionally, there are numerous rules in Regulation S -X as well as other disclosure requirements within GAAP that include a percentage disclosure threshold.2363 Based on staff 2360 See supra note 2321 and accompanying text. 2361 See PCAOB AS 2105, paragraph .03. 2362 See id., paragraph .07. 2363 See, e.g. , supra note 2063 and accompanying text; FASB ASC 280- 10-50-12 (requiring the reporting of separate information about an operating segment that meets certain q uantitative thresholds), 280 -10-50-14 (stating that if total of external revenue reported by operating segments constitutes less than 75% of total consolidated revenue, additional operating segments shall be identified as reportable segments (even if they\n",
            "page 216 : experience, we understand that auditors have developed procedures for auditing such disclosures and have not claimed an inability to audit that information. We expect auditors similarly will be able to apply the concepts of materiality and to audit the financial statement disclosures included in the final rules, particularly given the final rules’ narrower scope . Therefore, there is no need to delay the requirement to obtain an audit or exclude the financial statement disclosures from the scope of the audit or the registrants ’ ICFR . The rules we are adopting will provide the suitable criteria necessary for the disclosures to be subject to audit. Nevertheless, the Commission will work with the PCAOB to address any issues that come to light regarding the auditing of this information and will consider issuing additional guidance to the extent needed and helpful. Finally, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested that consultants or experts outside of the traditional accounting sector should be allowed to audit the proposed financial statement disclosures . 2364 The auditor’s unqualified opinion contains an expression of opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, which refers to a complete set of financial statements, including the related financial statements notes and any related sched ules. 2365 As stated above, we expect that the audit procedures applied to the financial statement note will be do not meet the criteria in paragraph 280 -10-50-12) until at least 75 % of total consolidated revenue is included in reportable segments), 280- 10-50-42 (stating, among other things, that if revenues from transactions with a single external customer amount t o 10% or more of a public entity’s revenues, the public entity shall disclose that fact, the total amount of revenues from each such customer, and the identity of the segment or segments reporting the revenues), and 323 -10-50-3 (requiring, among other things, disclosure of the names of any significant investee entities in which the investor holds 20% or more of the voting stock, but the common stock is not accounted for on the equity method, together with the reasons why the equity method is not considered appropriate, and the names of any significant investee corporations in which the investor holds less than 20% of the voting stock and the common stock is accounted for on the equity method, together with the reasons why the equity method is considered appropriate). 2364 See supra note 2327 and accompanying text. 2365 See PCAOB AS 3101, paragraph .08, The Auditor’s Report on an Audit of the Financial Statements When the Auditor Expresses an Unqualified Opinion .\n",

However, this does not mean t hat the auditor cannot use the work of an auditor specialist while performing its work if the auditor determines doing so would be appropriate in accordance with applicable auditing standards. PCAOB AS 2101, paragraph .16, Audit Planning, states that auditors should determine whether specialized skill or knowledge, such as an auditor specialist, is needed to perform the appropriate risk assessments, plan or perform audit procedures, or evaluate audit results. Auditors may use the work of auditors’ special ists to assist in their evaluation of significant account s and disclosures, including accounting estimates. In doing so, auditors consider the requirements within PCAOB AS 1201, Supervision of the Audit Engagement , when using the work of auditor -employed specialists, and AS 1210, Using the Work of an Auditor -Engaged Specialists , when using the work of an auditor engaged specialist, as appropriate. The Commission received mixed feedback about whether it would be clear that : (i) the financial statement dis closure requirements would be included in the scope of the audit when a 2366 See 15 U.S.C. 7212 (“It shall be unlawful for any person that is not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer, broker, or dealer.”). See also letter from CalPERS (“We expect that the regular auditor will do the audit.”).\n",

We believe that these disclosures are important and should be required regardless of the GAAP followed. Furthermore, r egistrants that file financial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB are subject t o the existing requirement to comply with Regulation S -X, 2368 and we are not aware of any policies that would prevent registrants from including the financial statement disclosures in a note in the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Further, the final rules will not alter t he basis of presentation of financial statements referred to in an auditor’s report. The instructions to Form 20- F make it clear that the issuer’s financial statements must be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. 2369 PCAOB AS 3101.08 states that the first section of the auditor’s report must include a “statement identifying each financial statement and any related schedule(s) that has been audited” and a “statement indicating that the financial statements, including the related notes and any related schedule(s), identified and collectively referred to in the report as the financial statements, were audited.” 2370 2367 See supra notes 2337 -2339 and accompanying text. 2368 See Acceptance from Foreign Private Issuers of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Without Reconcilia tion to U.S. GAAP, Rel.

A number of commenters provided feedback on the cost of the audit for the proposed financial statement metrics and some of these commenters suggested that the estimate included in the proposal was too low 2371 or that the proposed financial statement metrics would result in significant fees or an increase the cost of the audit.2372 Given the narrower scope of the final rules and their focus on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants ’ books and records and material impacts to financial estimates and assumptions rather than the proposed Financial Impact Metrics , we expect any increases to the cost of the audit due to the financial statement disclosures will be relatively modest for mos t companies . 2373 In addition, we agree with those commenters that stated the costs of auditing the proposed note to the financial statements would likely decrease or stabilize over time like other areas of audit work. 2374 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting share many similarities with other disclosures in the financial statements, in particular because they are based in transactions currently recorded in registrants’ books and records, and therefore the cost trajectory for auditing should be similar over time. 2371 See supra note 2344 and accompanying text. 2372 See supra notes 2343 and accompanying text. 2373 See infra section IV.C.3.b. v. 2374 See supra notes 2350 -2351 and accompanying text.\n",

By nar rowing the scope of financial statement disclosures and focusing on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants’ books and records and material financial estimates and assumptions, the final rules avoid many of the complexities associated with the proposed rules and therefore we do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures . L. Registrants Subject to the Climate -Related Disclosure Rules and Affected Form s 1.

              "\"risks and would provide investors wi th a more balanced perspective of the overall impacts of climate on a company’s business and operating performance .312 c. Final Rule s We are adopting final rule s (Item 1502(a)) to require the disclosure of any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, with several modifications in response to commenter concerns . 313 We disagree with t hose commenters who stated that a climate -related risk disclosure provision was not necessary because the Commission’s general risk factors disclosure rule already requires such disclosure . 314 In our view, a separate disclosure provision specifically focus ed on climate -related risks will help investors better understand a registrant’s assessment of whether its business is, or is reasonably likely to be, exposed to a material climate -related risk, and thereby enhance investor protection. Many commenters ind icated that the Commission’s current disclosure rules, including the general risk factor provision, has not provided investors with disclosure of climate - related ris ks and their financial impacts at the level of detail sought by investors that would make the disclosure useful for their investment or voting decisions. 315 The final rules , by contrast, are responsive to investors’ need for decision -useful information regarding registran ts’ material climate -related risks and will help ensure investors receive more consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures about such risks .316 312 See, e.g. , letters from Morningstar; P wC; and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (Jun. 16, 2022) (“WBCSD”). 313 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 314 See supra note 284 and accompanying text. 315 See, e.g. , supra note 102 and accompanying text; infra notes 395-397 and accompanying text. 316 See supra notes 244-249 and accompanying text. Furthermore, adopting a climate -related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions (set forth in Item 1500) and is based on the climate -related disclosure framework of the TCFD, with which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardiz ing climate -related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful information for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already providing some climate -related disclosure based on the TCFD framework. At the same time , we recogniz e that many commenters expressed significant concerns about the scope of the proposed rules , indicating that they may elicit too much detail, may be costly or burdensome, could result in competitive harm, or may obscure other material information .317 We have sought to address these concerns by modifying the definition of climate -related risks , by making the climate -related risk disclosure requirements less prescriptive, and by specifying the time frame s during which a registrant should describe whether any such material risks are reasonably likely to manifest , as discussed below .318 The proposed rule would have required a registrant to describe any climate -related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business or consolidated financial statements. We have substituted “results of operations” and “financial condition” for “consolidated financial statements” here and in several of the final rule provisions to be more consistent with other Commission rules relevant to risk assessment, such as Item 303 of Regulation S -K regarding MD&A. We have used the term “business strategy” in the final rules to more closely align the final rule s with the TCFD recommendation regarding the disclosure of the impacts of climate -related risks on strategy. T hese revisions do not create any 317 See supra notes 283 and 285. 318 See infra section II.C.2. substantive differences compared to the proposed rules but should facilitate compliance because many registrants should be familiar with the terminology used. Similar to the rule propos al, the final rules define climate -related risks to mean t he actual or potential negative impacts of climate -related conditions and events on a registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.319 To make a registrant’s determination of whether it is exposed to a material climate -related risk less burdensome, in respons e to commenters’ concerns,320 we have eliminated the reference to negative climate -related impacts on a registrant’s value chain from the definition of climate -related risk s. This change means that a climate -related risk involving a registrant’s value chain would generally not need to be disclosed except where such risk has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to materially impact the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, because a registrant may be able to assess the material risks posed by its value chain without having to request input from third parties in its value chain, this change will also limit the burdens of climate risk assessment on parties in a registrant’s value chain that might have occurred under the rule proposal. 321 regarding burdens associated with obtaining climate risk informatio n about their counterparties over which they lack control.323 Similar to the rule proposal, “acute risks” is defined as event -driven risks and may relate to shorter -term severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes , and wildfires .324 “Chro nic risks” is defined as those risks that the business may face as a result of longer term weather patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought, as well as related effects such as decreased arability of farmland, decreased h abitability of land, and decreased availability of fresh water.325 These enumerated risks are provided as examples of the types of physical risks to be disclosed and many represent physical risks that have already impacted and may continue to impact registrants across a wide range of economic sectors.326 The final rules define “ transition risks ” largely as proposed to mean the actual or potential negative impacts on a registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition attributa ble to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate -related risks. 327 For reasons discussed above in relation to the definition of “climate -related risks ,” we are no longer including value chain impa cts in the definition of “transition risks. ”328 The final rules’ definition of “ transition risk s” includes the same non- 323 See, e.g. , letter from Chamber. 324 See 17 CFR 229.1500. See infra section II.K.3.c.v for a discussion of the phrase “severe weather events” as used in s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K and Article 14 of Regulation S -X. 325 See id. 326 As discussed in more detail in section II.K.3.c.v , although Article 14 of Regulation S -X req uires a registrant to disclose certain financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which may include weather events that are not climate- related, subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K does not require the disclosure of material impact s from non -climate -related weather events. 327 See 17 CFR 229.1500. 328 As noted above , a registrant would only need to disclose the transition risk of a party in its value chain when such transition risk has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to materially impact the registrant itself. exclusive list of examples of transition risks as the rule proposal. Transition risks include, but are not limited to, increased costs attributable to climate -related changes in law or policy, reduced market demand for carbon -intensive products leading to decreased sales, prices, or profits for such products, the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adoption of new technologies, reputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant’s customers or business counterparties) that might trigger changes to market behavior, changes in consumer preferences or behavior, or changes in a registrant’s behavior. 329 Although some commenters asked the Commission to provide additional examples of transition risks in the definition,330 we decline to do so. The final rules’ examples are non - exclusive331 and, c onsistent with the TCFD framework, a registrant’s description of its material transition risks should include any type of transition risk that is applicable based on its particular facts and circumstances.332 The particular type of material transition risk disclosed may be one that is not included or only partially included in the definition. Not every manifestation of transition risk, however, may apply or be material to every registrant and transition risks are dynamic and may change over time . The proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose certain items of information about any material climate -related risk that a registrant has identified.333 In order to help address comment ers’ concerns that the rule proposal was too burdensome and could result in the disclosure of immaterial information , we have revised Item 1502, as adopted, to be less prescriptive . In doing so, we have sought to strike an appropriate balance between providing investors with more consistent and decision- useful information about material climate -related risks while being conscious of the costs to registrants and investors of requiring specified disclosures that may not be relevant in every circumstance. T he final rules provide that a registrant that has identified a climate -related risk pursuant to Item 1502 must disclose whether the risk is a physical or transition risk , providing information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presente d and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk.334 The final rules then provide a non- exclusive list of disclosure s that a registrant must disclose as applicable: • If a physical risk, whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk , and the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk;335 and • If a transition risk, whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and in vestor preferences), or other transition - related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.336 333 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. 334 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 335 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(i). 336 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1)(ii ). When proposing the climate -related disclosure rules, the Commission stated that in some instances, chronic risks might give rise to acute risks . For example, a drought (a chronic risk) might contribute to wildfires (an acute risk) , or increased temperatures (a chronic risk) might contribute to severe storms (an acute risk) . In such instances, the Commission indicated that a registrant should provi de a clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk , as well as how those risks have evolved or are expected to evolve over time.337 The final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. We agree, however, with commenters that indicated that requiring a discussion about the interaction of two related physical risks may, due to its complexity, increase the burden on the registrant without yielding a corresponding benefit for investors.338 While a registrant may opt to provide such discussion, it is not a mandatory disclosure item under the final rule s. We also agree with commenter s that stated that, for complex and overlapping physical risks, registrants can determine how best to categorize the physical risk as either acute or chronic.339 What is important is that a registrant describ e the climate -related physical risk s it faces cle arly and consistently, including regarding the particular categories of physical risk. As a disclosed risk develops over time, for example where the category of physical risk has changed and/or the nature of the impact to the registrant has evolved, depending on the facts and circumstances, the registrant may need to describe the changed risk in order for an investor to understand the impact 337 See Proposing Re lease, section II.B.1. 338 See, e.g. , letters from C EMEX ; Eni SpA; and ERM CVS. 339 See letter from IAA. or reasonably likely impact of the risk on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Some commenters opposed proposed Item 1502 because in their view it would be difficult for a registrant to distinguish between a climate -related physical risk and an ordinary weather risk,340 or between a business activity in response to a transition risk and one that is part of a routine business strategy.341 While we recognize that application of some of the Commission’s climate disclosure rules may initially be difficult for certain registrants , we expect that comp liance will become easier as registrants grow more familiar with disclosing how climate -related factors may impact their business strategies.342 In this regard, we note that many registrants are already providing some of the TCFD -recommended disclosures, a lthough in a piecemeal fashion and largely outside of the registrant’s Commission filings. In addition, we have modified the proposed rules in several places to require disclosure only if a registrant is already undertaking a particular analysis or practi ce or has already made a judgment that a particular risk is climate -related .343 Further, the lengthy phase in periods for the final rules will provide registrants additional time to develop, modify, and implement any processes and controls necessary to the assessment and reporting of a ny material climate -related risk.344 340 In this regard, a ccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) , weather refers to short -term changes in the atmosphere whereas climate describes what the weather is like over a long period of time in a specific area . See NOAA, What’s the Difference Between Weather and Climate? , available at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather -vs-climate . 341 See supra notes 289 and 298. 342 We also expect that compliance with the final rules will become easier as registrants commence disclosing climate -related information pursuant to other jurisd iction s’ climate disclosure requirements , to the extent those requirements are similar to the final rules . 343 See, e.g. , infra section II.D. 344 See infra s ection II.O. The final rule s include several changes from the proposal that mitigate some of the burdens of Item 1502(a) , as it was proposed. For example, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk, and to provide the Z IP code or other subnational postal zone.345 The final rules we are adopting no longer require such disclosure and instead include , as one of the physical risk items that a registrant must disclose, as applicable, the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the identified physical risk .346 This revision is intended to address the concern of many commenters that the proposed Z IP code disclosure requirement would be burdensome to produce and would likely not provide useful information for many investors.347 This revision will give registrant s the flexibility to determine the granularity of any location disclosure s based on their particular facts and circumstances as long as they provide information necessary to understand the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the material risk . The proposal would have called for specific information about physical risks, such as disclosures relating to flooding and the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high water stress. In particular, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant that faces a material physical risk due to flooding or water stress to disclose the percentage of buildings, plants, or properties that are located in flood hazard areas or the amount and percentage of assets located in water -stressed areas. In a change from the rule proposal, we have eliminated this proposed requirement in order to make the final rules less burdensome and permit the registrant 345 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. 346 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)(1). 347 See supra note 286 and accompanying text. to determine the particular metrics that it should disclose, if any, based on its particular facts and circumstances. Instead, the physical risk disclosure provision we are adopting is less prescriptive and subject to the general condition applicable to both physical and transition risk disclosure that, when describing a material climate -related risk, a registrant must provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. 348 These revisions help address the concern of some commenters that the proposed disclosure req uirements were too prescriptive and could result in overly granular and immaterial disclosure.349 The less prescriptive approach of the final rules also address es the concern of some commenters that the resulting disclosure could cause investor confusion by obscuring other disclosed risks that are presented in less detail .350 We expect that the final rules will elicit disclosures more reflective of a registrant’s particular business practices . With respect to those commenters who stated that th e required metrics disclosure should cover more than just water -related physical risks , the less prescriptive approach in the final rules eliminates any potential overemphasis on water -related physical risks and gives registrants flexibility to describe an y physical risks they may be facing .351 Finally , the revised approach in 348 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 349 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; CEMEX; NAM; and SIFMA. 350 See supra note 287 and accompanying text . As described below, the addition of materiality qualifiers to certain of the final rule’s climate risk disclosure requirements will also help address this concern by eliciting detailed disclosure only when it is material. See infr a section II.D. 351 See, e.g. , letters from CalPERS (recommending that the Commission should also require information on areas subject to droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires ); IAA (recommending that the Commission requir e registrants to provide quantitative details of the volume or revenue (percentage) contribution for facilities located in areas subject to water scarcity , flood risk , wildfires , and other climate -related natural disasters ); and Morningstar (recommending that the Commission go further in mandating quantitative disclosures related to a registrant’s assets exposed to physical climate risk, as such data is important across economic sectors). the final rules will allow a registrant’s disclosures to adapt to changing circumstances over time, while still providing sufficient information for investors to understand and assess any such changes. Similar to the physical risk rule provision, the final rule requires registrants to disclose the nature of any transition risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. It also includes a non- exclusive list of disclosures the registrant must provide, as applicable, including whether the transition risk relates to regulatory, technological, market , or other transition -related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant . 352 Describing the nature of an identified transition risk in this manner will help i nvestors understand the realized or potential material impacts of the identified transition risk and whether and how a registrant intends to mitigate or adapt to such risk. Consistent with the rule proposal, the final rule provision states that a registrant that has significant operations in a jurisdiction that has made a GHG emissions reduction commitment should consider whether it may be exposed to a material transition risk related to the implementation of the commitment. 353 Including this guidance within the rule text will serve to 352 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a) and 1502(a )(2). In a change from the proposal, the final rules omit a spec ific reference to liability and reputational factors from the transition risk disclosure required pursuant to Item 1502(a)(2). This change was made in order to conform more closely to the definition of “transition risks” in Item 1500, which refers to “regulatory, technological, and market changes.” Although this definition refers to impacts to a registrant’s liability or reputation as non -exclusive examples of negative impacts resulting from such changes, the definition of transition risks also refers to other examples of negative impacts that are not specifically mentioned in Item 1502(a)(2). To streamline the Item 1502(a)(2) disclosure requirement, and to avoid giving undue emphasis to impacts to a registrant’s liability or reputation over other transit ion risk -related impacts, we have removed the specific reference to liability and reputational factors and have retained the more general reference to “other transition -related factors.” A registrant that, due to regulatory, technological, or market changes, has incurred or is reasonably likely to incur a material negative impact to its reputation or liability will be required to include a description of such impact, together with any other material transition -related impact, in its disclosure pursuant to Item 1502(a)(2). 353 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a)( 2). remind registrants operating in such a jurisdiction that they may need to provide disclosure to investors about this specific type of transition risk. The proposed rule provisions pertaining to governance, strategy, and risk management would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to describe any climate -related opportunities it was pursuing when responding to those provisions.354 In this regard, the Commission proposed a definition of “climate -related opportunities” that was similar to the corresponding definition provided by the TCFD.355 While we are retaining the optional approach to disclosure related to climate -related opportunities, unlike the proposed rules, the final rules do not refer to climate - related opportunities and therefore do not include a corresponding definition. W e are treating the disclosure of climate -related opportunities the same as other voluntary disclosure. Accordingly, despite the absence of a corresponding provision, a registrant may elect to also include disclosure regarding any material climate -related opportunities it is pursuing or is reasonably likely to pursue in addition to disclosure regarding mat erial climate -related risks .356 2. Time Horizons and the Materiality Determination (Item 1502(a)) a. Proposed Rule The rule proposal would have required a registrant to describe any climate -related risks reasonably likely to have a material impact, which may mani fest over the short, medium, and long term. The rule proposal also would have required the registrant to describe how it defines 354 See Proposing Release, s ections II.B through II.E. 355 Compare Proposing Release, s ection II.B (proposing to define “climate -related opportunities to mean the actual or potential positive impacts of climate -related conditions and events on a registrant’s consolidated financial statements, business operations, or value chains, as a whole ) with TCFD, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures , Appendix 5 (defining “climate -related opportunity” to mean “ the potential positive impacts related to climate change on an organization ”). 356 Registrants have a fundamental obligation not to make materially misleading statements or omissions in their dis closures and may need to provide such additional information as is necessary to keep their disclosures from being misleading. See 17 CFR 230.408 and 17 CFR 240.12b- 20. “over whatever time period is relevant to a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances ”).371 Some commenters recommended bifurcating the climate risk disclosures into short -term and long- term timeframes, without a medium -term timeframe, similar to certain MD&A disclosures .372 One of those commenters stated that imposing a different temporal standard for climate risk disclosure would pose meaningful challenges to management as they seek to adapt their strategies and could result in misalignment of c limate -related disclosures with “ other, potentially more critical, strategically relevant disclosure issues, including the financial statements and MD&A. ”373 c. Final Rule In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact , a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters .375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long- term (i.e ., 371 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; and SIFMA; see also letter from NAM (stating that the relevant time periods should be short -term (18 to 24 months) and long- term (anything over 24 months), according to the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances). 372 See letter from ABA. 373 See id. 374 See 17 CFR 229.1502(a). 375 See, e.g. , letter from ABA. beyond the next 12 months) .376 The existing MD&A standard also generally requires that a registrant “ provide insight into material opportunities, challenges and risks, such as those presented by known material trends and uncertainties, on which the company’ s executives are most focused for both the short and long term, as well as the actions they are taking to address these opportunities, challenges and risks .”377 We are adopting this temporal standard to address the conce rn of commenters that imposition of a different temporal standard (and, in particular, one that includes a “medium term” period) for climate risk disclosure would pose challenges and potentially conflict with a registrant’s assessment of other risks and ev ents that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its future operations. 378 We note, however, that a registrant is not precluded from breaking down its description of risks reasonably likely to manifest beyond the next 12 months into components that may include more medium - and longer -term risks, if that is consistent with the registrant’s assessment and management of the climate -related risk. We are modeling the temporal standard in Item 1502(a) on this MD&A standard as recommended by commente rs because t he materiality determination that a registrant w ill be required to make regarding climate- related risks under the final rules is the same as what is generally required when preparing the MD&A section in a registration statement or annual report . MD&A require s a registrant to disclose material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be 376 See 17 CFR 229.303(b)(1). 377 See Commission Guidance Regarding Management’s Discussi on and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation , Release No. 33 -8350 (Dec. 19, 2003) [68 FR 75056 (Dec. 29, 2003)] .

A s defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important when determining whether to buy or sell securities or how to vote or such a reasonable investor would view omission of the disclosure as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available . 381 The materiality determination is fact specific and one that requires both quantitative and qualitative considerations.382 379 See 17 CFR 229.303(a). 380 See Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Infor mation , Release No. 33 -10890 (Nov. 19, 2020), [86 FR 2080, 2089 ( Jan. 11, 202 1)] (“2020 MD&A Adopting Release”). 381 See 17 CFR 230.405 (definition of “material”); 17 CFR 240.12b- 2 (definition of “material”).

Accordingly, management should make an objective evaluation, based on materiality, including where the fruition of future events is unknown.383 D. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Disclosure of Material Impacts (Item 1502(b), (c), and (d)) a. Proposed Rules The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate -related risks that it must disclose pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) .384 The Commission further proposed to requir e a registrant to include in such description any impacts on its: principles) . Staf f accounting bulletins are not rules or interpretations of the Commission, nor are they published as bearing the Commission's official approval. They represent interpretations and practices followed by the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant in administering the disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. Staff accounting bulletins and any other staff statements discussed in this release have no legal force or effect: they do not alter or amend applicable law, and they create no new or additional obligations for any person. 383 See, e.g. , 2020 MD&A Adopting Release. As noted above, the materiality determination that a registrant will be required to make regarding climate -related risks under the final rules is the same as what is generally required when preparing the MD&A section of a registration statement or annual report. Accordingly, registrants can look to the guidance in the 2020 MD&A Adopting Release regarding application of the “reasonably likely” standard when considering their disclosure obligations under the various components of Item 1502. According to this guidance, the reasonably likely standard “ is not intended to, nor does it require, registrants to affirm the non- existence or non -occurrence of a material future event. ” Rather, “it requires management to make a thoughtful and objective evaluation, based on materiality, including where the fruition of future events is unknown. ” 2020 MD&A Adopting Release , 86 FR at 2093. 384 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.1. used in Regulation S-K and might be interpreted by some registrants that do not have a business model as implying that they must adopt one.419 Some commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but recommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the most likely and significant impacts, which they asserted would provide more useful information for investors and reduce a registrant’s compliance burden. 420 Similarly , some commenters generally supported some form of climate disclosure while recommend ing that the Commission make the final rules more principles-based so that registrants could better tailor their disclosures to reflect their own particular facts and circumstances. 421 c. Final Rules The final rule provision (Item 1502(b)) will require a registrant to d escribe the actual and potential material impacts of any climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) on the registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook.422 Information about the actual and potential material impacts of climate -related risks on a registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook is central to understanding the extent to which a registrant’s business strategy or business model has changed, is changing, or is expected to change to address those impacts . This information is also central to evaluat ing management’s response to the impacts and the resiliency of the registrant’s strategy to climate -related factors as it pertains to the registrant’s results of 419 See letter from ABA. 420 See, e.g. , letters from Amazon; Beller et al.; and ICI. 421 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; Beller et al.; and Walmart. 422 See 17 CFR 229.1502(b). As used in the final rules , the term “ outlook” means “the prospect for the future,” consistent with its general definition . See Merriam -Webster Dictionary, available at https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/outlook . For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term “outlook” is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or forecasts in response to Item 1502(b) . operations and financial condition. N umerous commenters on the proposal shared some or all of these views .423 The proposed rule did not specifically include a materiality qualifier when requiring a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts of any identified climate -related risk in response to proposed Item 1502(a) . In practice, however, proposed Item 1502(b) would have elicited disclosure focused on material impacts because proposed Item 1502(a) would have required a registrant to describe only those climate -related risks that the registrant ha d identified as having materially impacted or being reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant .424 Nevertheless, w e recognize that , as proposed, Item 1502(b) may have caused some confusion regarding the scope of the proposed disclosure requirement.425 Some commenters misinterpreted the rule proposal as requir ing the disclosure of actual or potential impacts of climate -related risks, regardless of their materiality.426 We have, therefore, added an explicit materiality qualifier to Item 1502(b) to clarify that a registrant is only req uired to disclose material impacts of climate -related risks that it has identified in response to Item 1502(a). T his clarifying amendment will help address commenters’ concerns that the proposed rule could result in the disclosure of large amounts of imma terial information and thus be unduly burdensome for registrants . Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule provision was not necessary because the Commission’s existing rules generally require a registrant to disclose the effects of material 423 See supra note 395 and accompanying text. 424 See supra s ection II.C.1.a. 425 See, e.g. , letter from Fenwick West. 426 See, e.g. , letter s from Fenwick West ; and RILA. risks, including c limate -related risks .427 However, as other commenters have stated, many compani es do not discuss any climate -related risks in response to existing disclosure requirements .428 Accordingly, a rule provision that specifically requires the disclosure of material impacts of climate -related risks , and lists the types of potential material impacts that must be described, if applicable, will provide investors access to this information on a more consistent and comparable basis .429 The final rule provision largely lists the same types of potential material impacts of climate -related risks as under the rule proposal. The list, which is intended to be non- exclusive , includes , as applicable, material impacts on the registrant’s: • Business operations, including the types and locations of its operations; • Products or service s; • Suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available; • Activities to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes; and • Expenditure for research and development. If none of the listed types of impacts or any other impacts are material, a registrant need not disclose them. Similarly, if a registrant has identified a climate -related risk that has materially impacted or is reasonably likely to impact its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, but th e actual and potential material impact on its strategy, business 427 See supra note 414 and accompanying text. 428 See supra note 397 and accompanying text. 429 See, e.g. , letters from A mer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al. ; Eni SpA; and PRI. model, and outlook is not specifically listed in the final rule, the impact will need to be disclosed . By providing a non- exclusive list of material impacts of climate risks in the rule text, but not mandating that all or only these impacts be disclosed, the final rule will help elicit more meaningful and relevant disclosure without overburdening registrants or investors with the presentation of irrelevant information. We have revised one of the types of potential material impacts listed in the proposal that referenced “suppliers and other parties in [ a registrant’s ] value chain, ” by replacing this phrase with “[s]uppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available.” This revision is intended to address the concern of some commenters that requiring a registrant to include material impacts to a registrant’s value chain would be overly burdensome to both the registrant and to entities in the registrant’s value chain . 430 Thus the final rule limits the scope of this specific topic to include only material impacts to the registrant’s suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts and further limits the information that should be disclosed about those impacts to information that is known or is reasonably available.431 The adopted provision is consistent with the Commission’s general rul es regarding the disclosure of information that is difficult to obtain , which will apply to the final rules if their conditions are met .432 Accordingly, as modified, this provision will help limit the compliance burden of the final rules by eliminating any potential need for registrants to undertake unreasonable searches or requests for information from their value chains . 430 See supra note 416 and accompanying text. 431 See 17 CFR 229.1502(b)(3). Registrants are required to include material contracts in Commission filings under existing rules. See, e.g. , 17 CFR 229.601(b)(10). 432 See 17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 240.12b -21. Final Item 1502(c) will require a registrant to discuss whether and how the registrant considers any material impacts described in respo nse to Item 1502(b) as part of its strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation.433 Similar to the rule proposal, but modified to make Item 1502(c) less prescriptive, the final rule provision will require a registrant to include in its disclosure responsive to this provision, as applicable: • Whether the impacts of the climate -related risks described in response to Item 1502( b) have been integrated into the registrant’s business model or strategy, including whether and how resources are being used to mitigate climate- related risks; and • How any of the targets referenced in Item 1504 434 or in a described transition plan435 relate to the registrant’s business model or strategy. As noted by several commenters, t his provision will help investors assess a registrant’s resiliency to impacts of climate -related risks , by providing information about how management considers the realized or likely impacts of identified material climate -related risks on a company’s business model or strategy.436 In further response to commenters’ concern that the proposed rules were overly prescriptive and could result in a volume of information tha t could be confusing for investors ,437 we have streamlined the Item 1502(c) disclosure requirement. For example, we have omitted from the final Item 1502( c) provision the proposed requirement to “[p]rovide both current and 433 See 17 CFR 229.1502(c). 434 See infra s ection II.G. 435 See infra s ection II .D.2. 436 See supra note 402 and accompanying text. 437 See supra note 415 and accompanying text; see also letters from API; Chamber; NAM; SIFMA; and Soc. Corp. Gov. forward -looking disclosures ,”438 which should provide registrants with more flexibility to determine the appropriate disclosures needed in response to the requirement. We also have eliminated the requirement to describe how any of the financial statement metrics or GHG emissions metrics relate to the registrant’s business model or business strategy.439 Although a registrant may choose to include forward- looking information or discuss any climate -related metrics or financial information in response to Item 1502(c), the fina l rule leaves it up to each registrant to determine, based on its particular facts and circumstances, what disclosure is necessary to help investors understand whether and how management has incorporated the material impacts of its climate -related risks into its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation. In addition, to further streamline the disclosure and reduce some of the redundancy in the rule proposal, 440 we have eliminated from Item 1502 (c) the proposed disclosure requirement concerning t he role that the use of carbon offsets or RECs has played in a registrant’s climate - related strategy . Under the final rules, as part of its targets and goals disclosure ,441 a registrant will be required to provide disclosure concerning its use of ca rbon offsets or RECs if they constitute a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve its climate -related targets or goals.442 Given this targets and goals disclosure require ment , explicitly requiring disclosure concerning the use of carbon offsets and RECs in the context of Item 1502(c ) is not necessary . 438 See Proposing Release, section II.C.1. 439 See id. 440 One commenter stated that the Commission should follow the TCFD’s recommendation that “[d]isclosures should be eliminated if they are immaterial or redundant to avoid obscuring relevant information.” Letter from Chamber. 441 See infra s ection II. G. 442 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). We acknowledge the commenter who recommended that we delete the term “business model” in the proposed disclosure item;443 however, w e have retained the use of th is term in the final rule because requiring a registrant to disclose a material impact on its business model caused by a climate-related risk will provide important information to investors about the effectiveness of the registrant’s climat e risk management that would otherwise be lost were we to omit this reference. In addition, registrants generally should be familiar with the term even if not previously used in Regulation S-K. 444 Moreover, the TCFD uses that term in connection with disclosure about the resilience of a company’s strategy to climate- related risks , and as such, using the concept in the final rules will provide consistency for those registrants that have been providing climate -related inform ation based on that framework. 445 If a registrant has not yet articulated a business model, or does not believe that its business model is or will be materially impacted by climate -related risks, it need not provide the disclosure specified in this rule provision. Proposed Item 1502(d) would have required a registrant to provide a narrative discussion of whether and how any climate-related risks described in response to proposed Item 1502(a) have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrant’s consolidated financial statements. 446 When proposing Item 1502(d), the Commission explained that this provision was intended to elicit a discussion of the financial effects of climate -related risks similar to 443 See letter from ABA. 444 See, e.g., b usiness model, Oxford English Dictionary (2023), available at https://doi.org/10.1093/OED/2631068139 ; and business model, Cambridge Business English Dictionary (2023), available at https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/business -model . 445 See TCFD, supra note 159, at Table A2.1; IFRS, IFRS S2 Climate -related Disclosures ( June 2023); See also IFRS, IFRS S2 Accompanying Guidance on Climate -related Disclosures (June 2023 ). 446 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.1. MD&A.447 In a clarifying change from the propos al, and to address commenters’ concern that the proposed rule could result in immaterial disclosure,448 we have added materiality qualifiers to “have affected” and “are reasonably likely to affect” to clarify that Item 1502(d) requires a discussion only of material climate -related risks (i.e., climate -related risks that a registrant has identified as having had or being reasonably likely to have a material effect on the registrant ).449 In a further change from the proposal, the final rules refer to the regis trant’s “business, results of operations , and financial condition ” rather than “consolidated financial statements.” This is to reflect that the type of disclosure that is intended by this provision is more similar to that found in MD&A than that found in the notes to the financial statements .450 Proposed Item 1502(d) also would have required a discussion that included the financial statement metrics to be disclosed pursuant to proposed Article 14 of Regulation S -X. In a change from the proposal, Item 1502(d) (2) will require a registrant to describe quantitatively and qualitatively the material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, in management’s assessment , directly result from activities to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks disclosed pursuant to Item 1502(b)(4).451 Focusing the disclosure requirement on material expenditures that, based on management’s assessment, were incurred as a direct result of the registrant’s mitigation or adaptation activities w ill provide investors with a financial metric that is important to assessing the registrant’s management of the disclosed risk , 447 See id. 448 See supra note 415 and accompanying text. 449 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d) (1). 450 As previously noted, several commenters recommended making or linking any climate -related financial disclosure requirements under or with MD&A disclosure requirements. See supra note 409 and accompanying text. 451 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(2) . as well as assessing the financial impact of such activities . At the same time, linking the disclosure of the expenditures with management ’s assessment that they directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will more closely align the disclosure requirement with how the registrant actually evaluates a material climate -related risk . This will not only provide investors with important information about a registrant ’s strategic decision -making concerning a material climate -related risk but should also help the registrant determine whether there are material expenditures that must be disclosed, thereby lower ing the compliance burden, as some commenters noted.452 This disclosure requirement is intended to capture actual material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year for the purpose of climate -related risk mitigation or adaptation . As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant’s climate -related goals as part of a registrant’s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. 454 Although this commenter recommended that suc h expenditures disclosure be presented in tabular format, the final rule provision does not specify a particular format. The 452 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; and P wC. 453 See infra s ection s II.D.2 .c and II.G.3.a for a similar material expenditures disclosure requirement , respectively, as part of a registrant’s transition plan disclosure under Item 1502(e) and targets and goals disclosure under Item 1504 of Regulation S -K. To the extent that there is any overlapping disclosure of material expenditures in response to these Items, to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment , such disclosure is most appropriate, and then cross -reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items. 454 See letter from Amazon. As examples o f transition activities expenditures, this commenter presented costs and expenses related to electrifying its delivery fleet, renewable energy purchases, and carbon offset purchases. See id ., Appendix A. final rule also does not require disclosure of “discrete and separable” expenditures, as the commenter suggested . A registrant ma y present the material expenditures disclosure in tabular or narrative form according to how it believes such information best fits within its overall climate risk disclosure.455 Likewise, the final rules provide registrants with more flexibility than that suggested by the commenter to determine which and to what extent expenditures must be disaggregated or otherwise broken out. T his disclosure requirement covers material expenditures for the mitigation or adaptation of both physical risks and transition r isks. The final Regulation S-X provisions that we are adopting, on the other hand, do not cover financial impacts caused by transition risks .456 This Regulation S -K provision, therefore, will elicit disclosure s about material expenditures related to activ ities engaged in for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate -related risks in Commission filings while avoiding the difficulties of reporting such information in a note to the financial statements, as proposed.457 As discussed in more detail below,458 we recognize that some commenters on the proposed Regulation S -X amendments expressed concern regarding the attribution of expenses to climate risk mitigation activities. Specifically, these commenters stated that regist rants make business decisions, such as incurring an expenditure to purchase a piece of machinery that is 455 The structured data requirements set forth in It em 1508 will facilitate investors’ ability to find and analyze material expenditures disclosure regardless of whether provided in tabular or narrative form . See infra section II.M.3. 456 See infra s ection II.K . In addition, in a change from the proposal, the amendments to Reg ulation S-X do not require the disclosure of expenditures to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions . Therefore, under Item 1502, investors will also receive information about expenditures re lated to the mitigation of physical risks that they will not otherwise receive in the disclosures required by the amendments to Regulation S-X. 457 See supra note s 409 and 452 and accompanying text. The amendments to Regulation S-X will require the disclosure of expenditures related to carbon offsets and RECs, a type of transition activity, if carbon offsets and RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plans to achieve its disclosed climate - related targets o r goals in a note to the financial statements. See infra s ection II.K . 458 See infra sections II.K. 2.b.iii, 3.b and c. more energy efficient, for multiple reasons, and as a result, a registrant’s transition activities may be inextricably intertwined with its ordinary business activities.459 Although similar co ncerns could arise with respect to Item 1502(d) ’s expenditures disclosure requirement, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright -line threshold, as was proposed for th e Regulation S -X amendments , and limiting the disclosure to material expenditures that, in “management’s assessment, ” are the direct result of mitigation or adaptation activities, will help to mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns. In addition, in responding to the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the expenditure and how management has determined that it is a direct result of the disclosed transition activities , which may help alleviate concerns about potential liability exposure for attribution decisions .460 Requiring the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, from management’s assessment , directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will also provide investors with important information that will help them understand a registrant ’s climate risk management and assess any effects on its asset valuation and securities pricing.461 Registrants will similarly have the flexibility to explain qualitativ ely the nature of the impact on financial estimates and assumptions and how, in management ’s assessment , it is a direct result of the disclosed mitigation or adaptation activities. We recognize that registrants may need to develop new systems and adjust their DCP s to ensure th e accurate tracking and reporting of material expenditures and material impacts on 459 See infra note 1892 and accompanying text. 460 We note also that the “ significant contributing factor ” attribution principle applicable to certain disclosures required by the final rules in the financial statements , as well as any other guidance we provide below regarding the presentation of the disclosures in the financial statements, does not pertain to the expenditure disclosure in Regulat ion S-K. See infra section II. K.3.c . 461 See, e.g. , letter from IMA. financial estimates and assumptions that directly result from climate -related mitigation or adaptation activities .462 To accommodate such devel opment and adjustment , we are providing an additional phase in for the requirement to disclose this information in the context of Item 1502. Accordingly, a registrant will not be re quired to comply with t he Item 1502(d) (2) requirement until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its in itial compliance date for s ubpart 1500 disclosure s based on its filer status .463 2. Transition Plan Disclosure (Items 1500 and 1502(e)) a. Proposed Rule The Commission proposed to require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate -related risk management strategy to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks.464 The proposed requirements were int ended to help investors understand how a registrant intends to address identified climate -related risks and any transition to a lower carbon economy while managing and assessing its business operations and financial condition. The Commission proposed to define “transition plan” to mean a registrant’s strategy and implementation plan to reduce climate- related risks, which may include a plan to reduce its GHG emissions in line with its own commitments or commitments of jurisdictions within which it has significant operations. To allow for an understanding of a registrant’s progress to meet its plan’s targets or goals over 462 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; Cohn Rez ; HP; and IMA. 463 We are providing the same one- year phase in for the material expenditures disclosure requirement s being adopted in connection with a transition plan or a target and goal . See infra section II.O .3 below. 464 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.2. The Commission proposed to require transition plan disclosure in connection with a registrant’s risk management discussion. The final rules include transition plan disclosure as part of a registrant’s disclosure about climate -related risks and their impact on the registrant’s strategy to be consistent with TCFD’s recommended transition plan disclosure. See, e.g. , TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans (Oct. 2021) , available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021- Metrics_Targets_Guidance- 1.pdf . to the adoption of a transition plan because companies that intend to follow through on their transition plan commitments will want to assess their progress in achieving them and report on such progress and any climate -related opportunities they may be pursuing. 490 Other commenters, however, opposed the proposed updating requirement.491 One commenter stated that the proposed requirement would be burdensome for registrants and would act as a disincentive to the adoption of a transition plan. 492 Another commenter stated that, due to the long timeline of transition plans, annual progress updates w ould in many cases not provide meaningful information for investors .493 This comm enter recommended that there should instead be a requirement to annually report any actions taken to achieve transition plans that are material to the registrant, as well as any material positive or negative deviations from the plan or changes to it that a re material to the registrant. 494 Another commenter stated that a registrant should have to update its transition plan disclosure only when the registrant believes it is appropriate to do so, and such updating should occur at most on an annual basis.495 c. Final rule After consider ing comments received, we are adopting , with modifications from the proposal , a final rule provision (Item 1502(e)) that will requir e a registrant to describe a transition plan i f it has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk .496 Like the rule proposal, the final rules define (in Item 1500) a “transition plan” to mean a registrant’s strategy 490 See, e.g. , letters from Anthesis; and IATP. 491 See, e.g., letters from CEMEX; and SIFMA. 492 See letter from CEMEX. 493 See letter from SIFMA. 494 See id. 495 See letter from Unilever. 496 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e). and implementation plan to re duce climate- related risks , which may include a plan to reduce its GHG emissions in line with its own commitments or commitments of jurisdictions within which it has significant operations.497 The final rule s do not mandate that registrants adopt a transition plan; if a registrant does not have a plan, no disclosure is required. As noted in the Proposing Release, registrants may a dopt transition plan s to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks as an important part of their climate -related risk management strategy, particularly if the registrant has made commitments, or operates in a jurisdiction that has made commitments , to reduce its GHG emissions.498 We recognize that not every registrant has a transition plan and, as noted above, this rulemaking does not seek to prescribe any particular tools, strategies , or practices with respect to climate -related risks . If, however, a registrant has adopted such a plan, information regarding the plan is important to help investors evaluate a registrant’s management of its identified climate -related risks and assess the potential impacts of a registrant’s strategy to achieve its short - or long- term climate -related targets or goals on its business, results of operations, and/or its fina ncial condition. Moreover, a registrant’s transition plan may have a significant impact on its overall business strategy, for example, where companies operate in jurisdictions with laws or regulations in place designed to move them away from high emissions products and services.499 Because th e steps a registrant plans to take pursuant to its transition plan may have a material impact on its business , results of operations, or financial condition, investors have sought more detailed disclosure about transition plans .500 497 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (definition of “ transition plan ”). 498 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.2. 499 See supra s ection II.A. 500 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; BNP Paribas; and Morningstar. We disagree with commenter s that stated that transition plan disclosure should be voluntary501 and that a transition plan disclosure requirement was not necessary because the Commission’s existing business description rules would argua bly elicit sufficient disclosure of a registrant’s transition plan .502 As other commenters noted, many registrants are not providing decision -useful information about their transition plans under the Commission’s existing disclosure rules.503 While existing Item 101 of Regulation S -K may result in some disclosure regarding transition plans in response to the general requirements of that rule, m andatory disclosure about transition plans will help ensure that investors receive the information they need to evaluate a registrant’s management of material climate- related risks and the impact of those plans on its results of operations and financial condition in a more consistent and predictable manner. We are cognizant, however, of commenters’ concerns th at the proposed transition plan disclosure provision was overly prescriptive and could result in immaterial disclosure or discourage registrants from adopt ing a transition plan to avoid having to describe the plan in detail .504 To address these concerns, w e have significantly streamlined the transition plan disclosure provision and revised the provision so that the description of a transition plan is only required if a registrant has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk. Unlike the propose d rule, the final rule does not list the types of transition risks and factors related to those risks that must be disclosed, if applicable . 505 Instead, a registrant that is required to provide 501 See supra note 483 and accompanying text. 502 See supra note 480 and accompanying text. 503 See supra note 470 and accompanying text. 504 See supra notes 478 and 481 and accompanying text. 505 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.2. transition plan disclosure will have the flexibility to provide disclosure that addresses the particular facts and circumstances of its material transition risk .506 We also note that, as with scenario analysis and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant’s transition plan disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor. 507 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires a registrant to update its annual report disclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing any actions taken during the year under the plan, including how s uch actions have impacted the registrant’s business, results of operations , or financial condition.508 This updating requirement will help investors understand the registrant’s progress under the plan over time, track the impacts of a transition plan on a registrant’s business and, as noted by commenters, help inform investment decisions. 509 We disagree with the view of commenters who stated that this updating requirement would result in disclosure of information that is not meaningful for investors.510 Investors have indicated that they need periodic information regarding the steps a registrant has taken to achieve an announced climate- related target or goal in order to evaluate a registrant’s ongoing management of a material transition risk for the purpose of informing their investment 506 As discussed above, transition risk is defined as the actual or potential negative impacts on a registra nt’s business, results of operations, or financial condition attributable to regulatory, technological, and market changes to address the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate -related risks, such as increased costs attributable to changes in law or poli cy, reduced market demand for carbon -intensive products leading to decreased prices or profits for such products, the devaluation or abandonment of assets, risk of legal liability and litigation defense costs, competitive pressures associated with the adop tion of new technologies, and reputational impacts (including those stemming from a registrant’s customers or business counterparties) that might trigger changes to market behavior, consumer preferences or behavior, and registrant behavior . See 17 CFR 229.1500. 507 See infra section II.J.3. 508 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(1). 509 See supra note 488 and accompanying text. 510 See supra note 490 and accompanying text. or voting decisions.511 Once a registrant has provided disclosure about a transition plan it has adopted to manage a material climate risk, we do not expect that it would be particularly burdensome for the company to disclose update d information about actions taken under the plan on a going forward basis .512 Disclosure of the steps a registrant intends to make under a transition plan , and whether it has taken those steps, will help investors assess the financial impacts of the plan on the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition.513 Moreover, requiring this information on an annual basis will allow investor s to take into account current climate -related information in their investment and voting decisions more consistently than they would be able to if registrants were required to update their climate -related information less frequently or only when they deem ed it appropriate.514 We recognize that some commenters asserted that an updating requirement would act as a disincentive to the adoption of a transition plan. This effect may be attenuated, as some commenters indicated, 515 if registrants that have disc losed a plan wish to inform investors about progress achieved pursuant to the plan. In any event, if a registrant is using a transition plan to manage a material transition risk, we think it is appropriate for registrants to provide ongoing disclosure about the plan so that investors can assess its impact on the registrant’s business. 516 As previously noted, however, we are agnostic about whether or how a registrant is managing its 511 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; Anthesis; BNP Paribas; CalPERS; CalSTRS; Ceres; and Morningstar. 512 We note that s uch an update would not be required where disclosure of the underlying transition plan would not be currently required (e.g., because the plan is no longer used to manage a material transition risk). 513 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; BNP Paribas; and Morningstar. 514 See supra note 495 and accompanying text. 515 See supra note 490 and accompanying text. 516 To the extent that a registrant no longer uses a transition plan to manage a material climate risk, disclosure under this item, including the requirement for updates , would not be required. climate -related risks , and the final rules are intended neither to incentiv ize nor disincenti vize the use of a transition plan or any other climate risk management tool. In a modification of the proposed rule, which would have generally required the disclosure of the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage transition risk under a transition plan , the final rule will require a registrant, as part of its updating disclosure, to i nclude quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates a nd assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions taken under the plan.517 While this provision is similar to Item 1502(d), Item 1502(e) differs in that it is intended to elicit disclosure about material expenditures and material impacts on financ ial estimates and assumptions that directly result from actions taken under a transition plan (e.g., material expenditures made for climate- related research and development ). Item 1502(e) is not limited to disclosure concerning expenditures and impacts th at directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities ;518 however, t o the extent that a registrant’s disclosure made in response to Item 1502(d) or Item 1502(e) overlap with each other or with disclosure required under any other subpart 1500 provision,519 the registrant need not repeat the disclosure. Similar to Item 1502(d), the disclosure requirement under Item 1502(e) is intended to capture material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year under a 517 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e)(2). 518 See supra s ection II. D.1.c for a discussion of Item 1502(d) (2)’s requireme nt to disclo se material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions directly resulting from mitigation or adaptation activities . 519 For example, Item 1504(c)(2) requires similar disclosure regarding material impacts that directly result from actions taken by a registrant to achieve a disclosed target or goal. See infra s ection II.G.3. To the extent that there is any overlapping discl osure of material expenditures in response to Items 1502(d)(2), 1502(e), and 1504(c)(2), to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment , such disclosure is most appropriate, and then cross- reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items. transition plan, and to more closely align with how the registrant actua lly makes strategic decisions about taking actions under a transition plan. This provision will provide an important metric to help investors assess a registrant’s climate risk management and the financial impact of a transition plan while also helping to l imit the compliance burden, as some commenters noted. 520 We have not qualified Item 1502(e) by referring to management’s assessment as we have done in Item 1502(d) (i.e., material expenditures and material impacts that, in management’s assessment , direct ly result from the disclosed actions ). We believe that if a registrant has adopted a transition plan to manage a material transition risk , it is likely that management will oversee actions taken under the plan and, therefore , any material expenditures or material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that are disclosed will have been assessed by management as being the direct result of such actions. As under Item 1502(d), when responding to Item 1502(e), a registrant will have flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of a material expenditure or material impact on its financial estimates or assumptions and how it directly resulted from the disclosed actions taken under the plan. Additionally, when considering which expenditures related to actions taken under a disclosed plan are material over the relevant period and therefore require disclosure, if individual expenditures do not appear to be material , regi strants should consider whether overall expenditures related to actions taken under the plan are material in the aggregate and, if so, provide appropriate disclosure. For example, a series of individually immaterial expenditures could be the result of the same action or related actions under the plan, and those expenditures could be material in the aggregate . With respect to the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions, to the extent that 520 See, e.g., letters from Amazon; and PWC. such information is disclosed in response to Rule 14-02(h) of Regulation S -X, a registrant would be able to cross -reference to such disclosure .521 Similar to Item 1502(d)(2), to allow for the development of systems , controls , and procedures to track and report material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions directly resulting from actions taken under a transition plan, we are phasing in compliance with Item 1502(e)(2). A registrant will not be required to comply with either provision until the fiscal year immediately following the fisca l year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status .522 As recommended by one commenter,523 we have removed the reference to physical ris ks that was in the proposed rule .524 This change will make the transition plan disclosure requirement more consistent with voluntary disclosures that are based on the TCFD’s recommendation s,525 which may mitigate the costs and complexity of complying with t he final rule for registrants already familiar with the TCFD’s framework .526 A registrant that faces a material physical risk , however, will still be required to disclose how it is managing that risk as part of its risk management disclosure.527 These revisions will elicit material information for 521 We remind registrants that while they are permitted to cross -reference to information in their financial statement s to satisfy t heir Regulation S -K disclosure obligations , they are not permitted to cross -reference to Regulation S -K disclosures in their financial statements, unless otherwise specifically permitted or required by the Commission’s rules or by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the Interna tional Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) , whichever is applicable. See 17 CFR 230.411 and 17 CFR 240.12b -23. 522 See infra section II. O.3. 523 See letter from PRI. 524 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.2. 525 See TCFD, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans section E (Oct. 2021), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021- Metrics_Targets_Guidance- 1.pdf . 526 See, e.g. , infra note 2690 and accompanying text (describing a report finding that 50 percent of sustainability reports from Russell 1000 companies aligned with the TCFD recommendations ). 527 See 17 CFR 229.1503, discussed infra section II. F. investors about how a registrant intends to reduce its exposure to a material transition ris k while limiting the burdens on registrants and providing them more flexibility to de termine what aspects of the transition plan should be disclosed in light of their facts and circumstances . We are cognizant that s ome commenters expressed concern that t he proposed transition plan disclosure requirement would result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information that could cause competitive harm to the registrant.528 Modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to focus on material exp enditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions , rather than all rel evant metrics and targets , will help to mitigate this concern by providing registrants with more flexibility to determine what is necessary to disclose in order to de scribe the plan . Similarly , modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to require disclosure only when a plan has been adopted to manage a material transition risk will further help to mitigate this concern. Th is added flexibility regarding transition plan disclosure will also help address concerns that the final rule could act as a disincentive to adoption of transition plans. 529 While the final rules seek neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the adoption of transition plans, we recognize that the compliance burdens of disclosure may influence some registrants’ decisions with respect to risk management practices and have therefore sought to mitigate such effects . determining factor in whether disclosure is provided. Such a provision would fail to elicit disclosure of a material transition plan adopted by senior management that, due to a registrant’s particular corporate governance structure, is not required to be subject to a board vote but nevertheless has significant potential implications for the registrant’s financial condition or results of operations. Like the proposal, t he final rule does not require a registrant to disclose climate -related opportunities included in its transition plan. Nevertheless , as previously mentioned, a registrant may still elect to describe any opportunities that it intends to achieve as part of its transition plan discussion or when responding to any of the Item 1502 provisions . 531 We decline, however, to follow the recommendation of one commenter to require the disclosure of how a registrant intends to achieve any climate -related opportunities t hat are a part of its transition plan. 532 Consistent with the rule proposal, we have determined to treat disclosure regarding climate -related opportunities as optional , among other reasons, to allay any anti - competitive concerns that might arise from a req uirement to disclose a particular business opportunity.533 We believe those concerns could be exacerbated by requiring disclosure not only of the existence of opportunities in the transition plan but also how the registrant intends to achieve those opportunities. 3. Disclosure of Scenario Analysis If Used (Item s 1500 and 1502(f)) a. Proposed Rule The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the resilience of its business strategy in light of potential future changes in climate -related risks. 534 In connection with this 531 See supra section II.C .1.c. 532 See supra note 486 and accompanying text. 533 See Proposing Release, s ection II.A.1. 534 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.4. underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis disclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board as part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.557 Some commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly available scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) , the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) , or the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”) , to enhance the comparability of the scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each registrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its disclosure accordingly.559 c. Final Rule We are adopting a final rule (Item 1502(f)) requiring the disclosure of scenario analysis under certain circumstances . The disclosure of a registrant’s use of scenario analysis can provide important forward -looking information to help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant’s strategy under various climate -related circumstances.560 Scenario analysis has increasingly been recognized as an important analytical tool in assessing a company’s climate -related risk 556 See, e.g. , letters from ABA; and Chevron. 557 See letter from Amazon. 558 See, e.g. , letters fro m Anthesis; Bloomberg; CalSTRS; Chevron; and Shell plc (June 17, 2022) ( “Shell”). 559 See, e.g. , letters from American Council of Life Insurers (June 17, 2022) (“ACLI”); J. Herron; and TotalEnergies. 560 See supra note s 540-542 and accompanying text. exposure,561 and investors have increasingly sought information from registrants about their use of scenario analysis and expressed a need for improved disclosure about such use .562 Although some commenters recommended that we require all registrants to include scenario analysis disclosure in their climate risk reporting,563 we recognize that not every registrant conducts scenario analysis and, as noted above, this rulemaking does not seek to prescribe any particular tools, strategies , or practices with respect to climate -related risks but rather, when material, to provide investors with the information they need to evaluate the climate -related risks faced by the registrant and their potential impacts on the registrant’s business, resul ts of operations, or financial condition. Therefore, similar to the proposed rule, the final rule’s scenario analysis disclosure requirement will depend on whether and how a registrant use s such analysis . Importantly, the rule will not require a ny regist rant to conduct scenario analysis . We are, however , adopting modifications in the final rules . For example, we have added a materiality qualifier regarding the disclosure of scenario analysis to address commenters’ concern that the proposed requirem ent could result in disclosure of immaterial information that 561 See, e.g. , letter from AllianceBernstein (stating that “[s]cenario analysis is particularly important for those registrants in emissions -intensive industries where such analysis can demonstrate the quality of impairment testing and increase confidence in asset values”). The Federal Reserve Board’s climate scenario analysis pilot program, in which six of the nation's largest banks are voluntarily participating, further demonstrates the increased recognition of scenario analysis as an important tool to assess climate -related financial risks . See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board announces that six of the nation’s largest banks will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise designed to enhance the ability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate -related financial risks (Sept. 29, 2022), available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220929a.htm . 562 See, e.g. , letters from AllianceBernstein (stating that “[w]hile many registrants claim to perform scenario analysis, however, there is little disclosure around assumptions used in these models and how registrants use results impact strategy, business and capital allocation decisions, making their results challenging t o compare”); and Ceres ( citing evidence from the Climate Action 100+ Benchmark that companies ’ “scenario analys es leave much room for improvement ”). 563 See supra note 543 and accompanying text. would be burdensome and costly to produce .564 We also note that, as with transition plan and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant’s scenario analysis disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor.565 The final rule provides that, if a registrant uses scenario analysis566 to assess the impact of climate -related risks on its business , results of operations, or financial condition, and i f, based on the results of scenario analysis, a r egistrant determines that a climate -related risk is reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, then the registrant must describe each such scenario ,567 including a brief description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used, as well as the expected material impacts, including financial impacts , on the registrant under each such scenario.568 We are adopting this disclosure requirement because, if a registrant has used scenario analysis to assess and manage a material climate- related risk, investors need to understand how it conducted that analysis in order to evaluate the registrant’s conclusions regarding material impacts on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. We also have streamlined the proposed scenario analysis disclosure requirements to reduce redundancy in the final rules . For example, we have eliminated the introductory 564 See supra note 554 and accompanying text. 565 See infra section II.J.3. 566 We are largely adopting the definition of scenario analysis, as proposed. See 17 CFR 229.1500 (“S cenario analysis means a process for identifying and assessing a potential range of outcomes of various possible future climate scenarios, and how climate- related risks may impact a registrant’s business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition over time .”) We have deleted from the definition the example that “registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies un der certain future climate scenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 °C, 2 °C, and 1.5 ºC above pre - industrial levels ” because we do not wish to convey the impression that these scenarios are required should a registrant elect to conduct scenario analysis . 567 See 17 CFR 229.1502(f). Conversely, if a registrant conducts scenario analysis and determines from its results that it is not likely to be materially impacted by a climate -related risk, no disclosure about its use of scenario analysis is required under Item 1502(f). 568 See id. provision in the rule proposal requir ing a registrant to describe the resilience of its business strategy in light of potential future changes in climate -related risks . Because companies use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their business strat egies under varying future climate scenarios, and because such use is explained in the definition of scenario analysis (in Item 1500) that we are adopting largely as proposed,569 if registrants are required to disclose their use of scenario analysis under t he final rules, such disclosure likely would include a description of the resilience of their strategies under various climate scenarios. The rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose “any analytical tools, such as scenario analysis” that it uses to assess the impact of climate -related risks on its business. In a modification of the proposed rule, we have eliminated the reference to “any analytical tools” to clarify that the disclosure required by this provision should concern the re gistrant’s use of scenario analysis rather than an y other analytical tool s. We note that the TCFD’s guidance discusses scenario analysis as the primary tool to help companies assess the impacts of climate - related risks on their business strategies , and therefore this change should eliminate any confusion about what other analytical tools might fall under the scope of the requirements .570 In another change from the rule proposal, we have added the term “brief” to modify the “description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used” prong of the scenario analysis disclosure provision. The adopted provision will continue to el icit disclosure that will enhance investors’ assessment of the resiliency of a registrant’s strategy while also mitigating the compliance burden for registrants . Requiring a brief description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used , together with a description of the projected material financial 569 See 17 CFR 229.1500. 570 See TCFD, supra note 332332. impacts on the registrant’s business strategy under each scenario, should help elicit disclosure that neither burdens investors with immaterial detail nor unduly adds to a registrant’s complianc e burden. As with disclosure related to transition plans, we reiterate that our focus in adopting these requirements is neither on incentivizing nor disincentivizing any particular risk management practice but rather on providing investors with the inform ation they need with respect to the particular practices of a registrant in order to make informed investment and voting decisions. These revisions to the proposed rule also address commenters’ concern that the required scenario analysis disclosure could result in the disclosure of confidential business information. 571 If a registrant has used scenario analysis to determine that an identified climate- related risk is likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, it is important for investors to receive disclosure about that material impact. T he registrant will not, however, be required to provide a lengthy description of the underlying parameters and assumptions that may be more likely to reveal confidential business information. Although some commenters recommended that we require the use of one or more climate scenario m odels, 572 the final rules do not impose a ny specific risk management model . By requiring disclosure based on whether a registrant has determined to conduct scenario analysis as part of its consideration of material climate -related risks, a registrant will be able to select the climate scenario model or models that it believes best fits its particular industry or business , or its climate risk assessment approach . This approach will provide useful information to investors 571 See supra note 552 and accompanying text. 572 See supra note 558 and accompanying text. about the resilience of a registrant ’s climate -related business strategy while also helping to limit the registrant’s compliance burden relating to scenario analysis disclosure under the final rules . The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered “ an increase of no greater than 3 ºC, 2 ºC, or 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels .”573 Because th is was for illustrative purposes only, and because we have removed the same example from the definition of scenario analysis to avoid conveying the impression that these scenarios are required ,574 we have also removed the example from Item 1502(f). To further streamline the scenario analysis disclosure requirement , we have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information.575 We recognize that, as noted by some commenters, scenario analysis practices are still evolving,576 and that, in the early stages of use, a registrant’s disclosure regarding its use of scenario analysis may be qualitative. As a registrant’s use of scenario analysis becomes more sophisticated, we would expect its disclosure of the results of scenario analysis to become more quantitative, particularly when discussing the expec ted material financial impacts on the registrant’s business strategy, under each considered scenario, which, like the proposed rule, must be addressed should a registrant be required to disclose its use of scenario analysis. Streamlining the proposed scenario analysis disclosure requirement in this way will enable a registrant to determine the mix of qualitative and quantitative disclosure that best fits its particular circumstances when satisfying its obligations under the final rule . 573 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.4. 574 See supra note 566 and accompanying text. 575 See id. 576 See, e.g. , letters from Bloomberg; and Chamber. We decline to follow the recommendation of one commenter who stated that disclosure of scenario analysis should only be required when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.577 Conditioning the disclosure requirement in this way could deprive i nvestors of needed information solely because the registrant has not yet announced the corresponding strategy or initiative. 4. Disclosure of a Maintained Internal Carbon Price (Item 1502(g)) a. Proposed Rule The Comm ission proposed to define an internal carbon price to mean an estimated cost of carbon emissions used internally within an organization.578 The Commission also proposed that, if a registrant maintains an internal carbon price, it would have to disclose: • The price in units of the registrant’s reporting currency per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (“ CO 2e”); • The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over time, if applicable; • The boundaries for measurement of overall CO 2e on which the total price is based , if different from the GHG emission organizational boundary required pursuant to the proposed GHG emissions disclosure provision; and • The rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.579 The proposed rules would have further required a r egistrant to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage climate- related risks. In addition, the proposed 577 See letter from Amazon . 578 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. 579 See id. disclosures, such as an approach similar to t he Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB ”) standardized measure of oil and gas, or SMOG .606 c. Final Rule The final rule (Item 1502(g)) will require a registrant that uses internal carbon pricing to disclose certain information about the internal carbon price , if such use is material to how it evaluates and manages a climate- related risk that, in response to Item 1502(a), i t has identified as having materially impacted or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. At the same time, we recognize commenters’ concern that, without a materiality qualifier, the proposed rule could have result ed in the disclosure of internal carbon pricing data that would 606 See letter from Chevron (recommending “a disclosure requirement similar to FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 932, which requires a standardized measure of discounted future cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves quantities, often referred to as the standardized measure of oil and gas, or SMOG”). 607 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g). 608 See supra notes 581-585 and accompanying text. We also note, based on current voluntary reporting, a n increasing trend among public companies to use internal carbon pricing. See CDP, Putting a Price on Carbon (2021), available at https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp- production/cms/reports/documents/000/005/651/original/CDP_Global_Carbon_Price_report_2021.pdf . not be decision -useful for investors and would be burdensome for registrants to produce.609 To address this concern, in a change from the proposed rule, which would have required internal carbon pricing disclosure whenever a registrant maintain s an intern al carbon price, the final rule will require th is disclosure only when the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing is material to how it evaluates and manages a climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) . If a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing is material, similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will require it to disclose in units of the registrant’s reporting currency: • The price per metric ton of CO 2e; and • The total price, including how the total price is estimated to change over the time periods referenced in Item 1502(a), as applicable .610 Similar to the proposed rule, if a registrant uses more than one internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate -related risk, it must provide the required disclosures for each internal carbon price, and disclose its reasons for using different prices.611 We also have included a provision, similar to the rule proposal and as recommended by some comm enters,612 stating that if the scope of entities and operations involved in the use of a described internal carbon price i s materially different than the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of calculating a registrant’s GHG emissions pursuant to the final rule , the registrant must briefly describe this difference.613 609 See supra note 600 and accompanying text. 610 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(1). 611 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(2). 612 See supra notes 592-593 and accompanying text. 613 See 17 CFR 229.1502(g)(3). We are requir ing disclosure of this information because, as commenters noted, it will help investors understand a registrant’s internal carbon pricing practice and how such practice has contributed to the registrant’s overall evaluation and planning regarding climate -related risk.614 Increased transparency about internal carbon pricing by registrants that use an int ernal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate- related risk, in particular a material transition risk, will help investors understand the assumptions and analyses made by registrants when determining and managing the likely financial impacts of such risks on the company. Moreover, including a requirement to disclose any material difference in the boundaries used for internal carbon pricing and GHG emissions measurement will help minimize investor confusion about the scope of entities and oper ations included in a registrant’s application of internal carbon pricing and improve transparency about the methodology underlying the use of internal carbon pricing so that investors may better compare such use across registrants . 615 To streamline the internal carbon price disclosure requirement and to reduce redundancy, we have eliminated the proposed requirement to describe how a registrant uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage climate- related risks. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is likely to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate- related risk when responding to other final rule provisions, such as when describing a related transition plan,617 even if the description of internal carbon pricing is less detailed because it is part of a broader narrative discussion. To further streamline the internal carbon price disclosure requirement, we 614 See supra notes 590-591 and accompanying text. 615 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; and PRI. 616 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. 617 See 17 CFR 229.1502(e). have eliminated from the final rule the proposed requirement s to disclose the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.618 By streamlining the internal carbon price disclosure requirement in this way and adding materiality qualifiers , the final rules will help ensure that investors receive material information about the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing to inform their investment and voting decisions while limiting the compliance burden for registrant s. Moreover, eliminating the proposed requirement to provide a separate narrative description of how a registrant uses an internal carbon price and the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied will help address commenters’ concerns that the proposed disclosure requirement would result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information and act as a disincentive to using an internal carbon pricing mechanism . 619 We also note that, as with tra nsition plan and scenario analysis disclosure, disclosure of a registrant’s use of an internal carbon price will be subject to a safe harbor. 620 Because of these changes to the proposed rule, we believe that it is unnecessary to adopt an exemption or excep tion to the internal carbon price disclosure requirement , as some commenters recommended,621 or a separate phase in for the disclosure requirement, as recommended by other commenters .622 618 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. 619 See supra note 596 and accompanying text. 620 See infra s ection II.J. 3. 621 See supra note s 602-603 and accompanying text. 622 See supra note 604 and accompanying text. c. Final Rule We are adopting the proposed requirement s to disclose board oversight of climate -related risks (Item 1501(a)) , with some modifications to address the concerns of commenters. These disclosures will enhance investors ’ ability to evaluate a registrant’s overall manag ement of climate -related risks by improving their understanding of the board’s role in overseeing those risks .665 The final rule will require a description of a board of directors’ oversight of climate - related risks, as proposed.666 The final rule will also require the identification , if applicable, of any board committee or subcommittee responsible for the oversight of climate -related risks and a description of the processes by which the board or such committee or subcommittee is informed about such risks . Further, if there is a target or goal disc losed pursuant to § 229.1504 or transition plan disclosed pursuant to § 229.1502(e)(1), the final rule will require disclosure of whether and how the board oversees progress against the target or goal or transition plan.667 These disclosures are not requir ed for registrants that do not exercise board oversight of climate - related risks. Despite the concerns expressed by several commenters, the proposed rules were not intended to shift governance behaviors , including board composition or board practices . Similarly, the final rule s neither seek to influence registrants ’ decisions about how to manage climate -related risks nor does their design incorporate, reflect , or favor any governance structure 665 See, e.g. , letters from Ceres ; PRI; and RMI. 666 We are also adding Instructio n 1 to Item 1501 to clarify that in the case of a foreign private issuer with a two-tier board of director s, the term “ board of directors ” means the supervisory or non -management board. In the case of a foreign private issuer meeting the requirements of 17 CFR 240.10A –3(c)(3), the term board of directors ’ means the issuer ’s board of auditors (or similar body) or statutory auditors, as applicable . 667 The proposed governance provision state d that a registrant may also describe the board of directors’ oversight of climate -related opportunities. As previously mentioned, although the final rules do not contain a similar provision, a registrant may elect to provide such disclosure as part of it s governance disclosure. or process . Rather, consistent with our statutory authority, the final rules focus on disclosure of registrants’ existing or developing climate -related risk governance practices. We recognize that registrants have varied reasons for pursuing different oversight arrangements, and some registrants may reasonably de termine that climate -related risks are not among the most pressing issue facing the company. The final rule s will provide investors with the information they need to understand and evaluate those oversight arrangements and make informed investment decisio ns in light of their overall investment objectives and risk tolerance . Furthermore, as stated above, these disclosure requirements apply to those registrants the boards of which exercise oversight of climate -related risks ; no disclosure is required for re gistrants that do not have information responsive to the disclosure requirements . We are not adopting some of the more prescriptiv e elements of the proposal in response to commenter concerns. Specifically , we are eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose: • The identi ty of specific board members responsible for climate -risk oversight; • Whether any board member has expertise in climate- related risks and the nature of the expertise; • How frequently the board is informed of such risks ; and • Information regarding whether and how the board sets climate -related targets or goals, including interim targets or goals. While the proposal would have required this disclosure only to the extent applicable, we appreciate the concerns of some commenters who stated that these elements of the proposal could have unintended effects on the registrant’s governance structure and processes by focusing on one area of ris k at the expense of others . In addition, some commenters raised concerns that the level of detail required by the proposal would cause registrants to divulge sensitive internal board processes . It may be that a registrant, in describing “ the board of directors’ oversight of climate -related risks ,” will find it necessary to disclose, or otherwise choose to disclose , some or all of the information called for by the proposal. But , by adopting a more streamlined rule, we intend to eliminate any mis percept ion that this information is required for all registrants , particularly those without existing processes or information to disclose . We are, however, adopting the proposed requirement to identify any board committee or subcommittee responsible for the ove rsight of climate -related risks , if a registrant has such a committee or subcommittee. T his information is important to an understanding of how the board is managing such risk and will not be burdensome to disclose . Moreover, the provision simply require s the registrant to identify any committee or subcommittee that has been tasked with managing climate -related risks and is not designed to influence decisions about whether and how the board allocate s responsibility for oversight of such risk. We are also adopting a requirement, albeit modified from the proposal, to describe whether and how the board of directors oversees progress against disclosed climate -related tar gets, goal s, or transition plan s. By tying this disclosure requirement to circumstances in which the registrant has a disclosed climate -related target , goal , or transition plan, the final rule will avoid generating detailed disclosure about matters that are not important to investors. In addition , in light of commenter concerns regarding the proposed disclosure of whether and how the board of directors establishes any final or interim targets or goals,668 we are omitting this requirement from the final rule. Overall, the less prescriptive approach to disclosure in the final rule will facilitate investors ’ understanding of how a registrant intends to manage a target or goal that is material to its business while 668 See supra note 663 and accompanying text. discouraging boilerplate disclosures and avoiding any unintended adverse effects on the board’s governance structures . We are also adopting the proposed requirement to describe the processes by which the board or a ny board committee or subcommittee is informed about climate -related risks, while eliminating the requirement to describe the frequency of these discussions . While some commenters stated that it would be helpful to investors for registrants to disclose both the processes and frequency of these discussions ,669 other commenters expressed concern that this disclosure will shift governance behavior.670 The final rules balance investors’ need to understand the board’s governance of climate- related risks in sufficient detail to inform an investment or voting decis ion with concerns that the proposal could inadvertently pressure registrants to adopt specific or inflexible climate -risk governance practices or organizational structures or otherwise influence the conduct of the board. By retaining the requirement to disclose the process by which the board is informed, investors will have meaningful information that they can use to assess the conduct of boards in dealing with climate -related risks while avoiding overly detailed or granular disclosure s that could unduly influence such processes . Although some commenters asserted that registrants may feel pressure to appoint certain individuals with climate expertise,671 we re emphasize that the Commission remains agnostic about whether and/or how registrants govern clima te-related risks . Registrants remain free to elect whether and how to establish or retain the procedures and practices that they determine best fit their business . The focus of the final rules remain s on investor protection and improving 669 See, e.g. , letter s from FTLT ; Morningstar ; and PRI. 670 See supra note 655. 671 See supra note 646. investors’ acces s to comparable and consistent climate -related disclosure s. The final rules are focused on disclosure and do not require , and are not formulated to prompt, registrants to chang e their governance or other business practices. We are not, as suggested by some commenters, adopting a materiality qualifier for this portion of the final rule. As discussed above, we have revised the final rule from the proposal to make the disclosure requirement less prescriptive. As such, registrants wil l have additional flexibility to determine how much detail to provide about the board’s oversight of climate -related risk. T hese revisions help mitigate some comme nters’ concerns that the rule will require disclosure of immaterial information. T he specif ic information called for by the final rule will provide important context for an investor to evaluate the extent to which the board is evaluating climate -related risk s. If a board of directors determines to oversee a particular risk, the fact of such ove rsight being exercised by the board is likely material to investors given other demands on the board’s time and attention .672 Moreover, unlike management, which likely oversees many more routine matters, some of which may not be material to investors, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to the company and limited in number. Accordingly, we do not believe that a materiality qualifier is necessary for this provision. 2. Disclosure of Management Oversight (Item 1501(b)) a. Proposed Rules Similar to the proposed disclosures on board oversight, the proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose a number of it ems, as applicable, about management’s role in the assessment and managem ent of climate -related risks. First, the Commission proposed to require 672 See discussion infra section II.E.2.c ( regarding our reasons for adding a materiality qualifier to Item 1501(b) ). optional and not mandatory,706 others indicated that how companies are responding to highly dynamic opportunities is material information and therefore should be required to be disclosed.707 One commenter stated that climate -related opportunity reporting is likely to be adopted in both the EU and UK , and t herefore, to streamline mandatory disclosures for dual ly- listed co mpanies , the commenter recommended that the Commission require this disclosure , except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant’s principal line of business .708 c. Final Rule We are adopting the proposed requirement to disclose management oversight of climate related risks (Ite m 1501(b)) with some modifications t o address the concerns of commenters. The final rule s will, like the proposed rules, require that registrants describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate -related risks . As commenters stated , investors need information about how management -level staff assess and manage material climate -related ris ks to make informed investment and voting decisions. However, we are limiting the disclosure required by this final rule provision to material climate -related risks , as suggested by commenters ,709 given the multitude of climate -related matters that may be overseen by management . The final rule s also specif y that a registrant should address, as applicable, the following non- exclusive list of disclosure items when describing management’s role in assessing and managing the registrant’s material climate -related risks : • Whether and which management positions or committees are responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risks , and the relevant expertise of such position holders or 706 See, e.g. , letter from CEMEX. 707 See, e.g. , letter from CHRE and Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. 708 See, e.g. , letter from We Mean Business Coalition (June 1 3, 2022) (“We Mean Business”). 709 See, e.g. , letters from MFA ; and RILA. committee members in such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise; • The processes by which such positions or committees assess and manage climate -related risks; and • Whether such positions or committees report information about such risks to the board of directors or a committee or subcommittee of the board of directors . The n on-exclusive list of disclosures in Item 1501(b) should help elicit specific information about management’s oversight of climate -related risks and thereby mitigate any tendency towards boilerplate disclosures. At the same time , by focusing the disclosure on management ’s role in assessing and managing material climate -related risks , the final rules will provide registrants with the flexibility to tailor the disclosures based on their particular governance structure . Given these changes, we believe the final rule appropriately balances investors’ needs for information to understand management’s involvement in assessing and managing material climate risks with concerns that a more prescriptive rule could have adverse consequences on registrants’ governance practices or organizational structures. We reiterate, as we did above with respect to our rules requiring disclosure of board oversight of climate -related risks, that the final rule does not seek to influence decisions about how to manage climat e-related risks or otherwise change registrant behavior . Rather, the final rule seek s to elicit disclosure about existing oversight practices that will allow investors to make better informed judgments about registrants’ oversight processes and mechanisms in light of their overall investment objectives and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the final rule does not require registrants that do not engage in the oversight of material climate -related risk to disclose any information. We are mindful of the suggestions of some commenters that we adopt additional requirements to disclose information related to management oversight of climate -related risks, including descriptions of internal positions and reporting structures and detailed information about clim ate-based remuneration . However, consistent with our overall goal to streamline the proposed requirements and to focus on management’s over sight of material climate -related risk , we are not including such additional disclosure elements in the final rule.710 We are adopting the proposal requir ing a description of the relevant expertise of position holders or members responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risk .711 While we considered the view of commenters that this could cause registrants t o feel compelled to find and hire management with such expertise, regardless of whether that is the most sensible use of managerial resources given the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances , the added qualification that disclosure is only required where the risk is material mitigates this concern. We agree with commenters that asserted that this information will be helpful to understanding a registrant’s ability to manage climate -related risk s given the direct role that management will play in overseeing any such risks yet emphasize that registrants are required to make this disclosure only if they have identified a material climate risk . As noted above, the final rule has been modified to eliminate many of the prescriptive disclosure elements from the proposal , and it instead provides a non -exclusive list of the types of 710 Although we are not adopting specific requirements related to e xecutive management remuneration linked to climate -based incentives , to the extent a climate -related target or goal or other measure is a material element of a registrant’s compensation of named executive officers, such information is required to be disclosed under Item 402(b) of Regulation S -K. 711 Further, we are addin g Instructio n 2 to Item 1501 to clarify that r elevant expertise of management in Item 1501(b)(1) may include, for example: p rior work experience in climate -related matters; any relevant degrees or certifications; any knowledge, skills, or other background in climate -related matters . disclosure s that a registrant should include, as applicable, when describing management’s role in assessing and managing the registrant’s material climate -related risk. For example, if applicable , registrants should describe the processes by which certain positions or committees are informed about and monitor climate -related risks. A process -based description of management’s governance of material climate -risks can offer investors a meaningful look at how registrants manage material climate -related risk s. Registrants should also disclose, if applicable, whether management reports to the board or a subcommittee of the board on climate -related risks. Elimination of the proposed requirement to disclose how frequently the board meets to discuss climate -related matters, as discussed above, address es commenters’ concerns that this disclosure , if provided, could divert limited resources from the consideration of other material risks and encourage changes to business practices . Nonetheless , information on whether management reports to the board can provide needed clarity on the connection between board and management level governance of climate -related risks , and accordingly, we have retained it as an example of the type of disclosure that might be responsive to the rule . We have also added a reference to a subcommittee of the board because some registrants may establish a subcommittee to focus on climate -related issues. Finally, as noted above ,712 we are not adopting the proposed rule that would have allowed , but did not require , registrants to describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate -related opportunities. As with other voluntary disclosure, registrants may elect to include su ch disclosure. While we recognize that some commenters recommended that such disclosure be mandatory, we have determined to treat the disclosure regarding climate - 712 See section II.C.1.c. related opportunities as optional , among other reasons, to allay any anti -competitive concer ns that might arise from a requirement to disclose a particular business opportunity.713 These changes will also help address the concerns expressed by some commenters , including from smaller reporting companies and registrants in certain industries,714 that the proposed rules would unduly pressure such registrants into a one -sized -fits-all governance approach given the line of business, size, and structure of their companies.715 While we disagree with one commenter’s suggestion that the proposal would “ mandate that every company in the United States be required to expand management structures in order to accommodate concerns that are not material to a company ,”716 shifting to a non- exclusive list of topics that a registrant should address, as applicable, will mitigate the concerns raised by some commenters that the prescriptiveness of the proposed disclosures could lead to such a result . In addition, the flexibility afforded to re gistrants under the final rule to determine which details about management’s oversight of climate -related risks to include in their disclosure will help alleviate concerns that the proposal would elevate climate -related disclosures above other , equally important, disclosures . Furthermore, as stated above, the final rule does not impose any disclosure requirements on registrants that do not exercise management oversight of climate - related risks. 713 See Proposing Release, s ection II.A.1. 714 See, e.g. , letter from BIO. 715 See, e.g. , letter from Chamber (“ We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk. The Proposed Rule, if adopted, would present a costly distraction for companies with limited resources (particularly small- cap and many mid- cap companies) to attempt to align their behavior and disclosures with those of other companies that similarly f elt pressured by the rule to adapt their behavior to what appears to be the SEC’s preferred response to climate- related risks.” ). 716 See letter from BIO. principles -based , and cautioned that the prescriptiveness of the rule proposal would lead to boilerplate language that would not provide decision -useful information to investors.762 3. Final Rule After considering the comments received, we are ad opting a requirement (Item 1503), modified from the proposal as discussed below , to describe any processes the registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks.763 We agree with those commenters that stated investors need more comprehensive disclosure of registrants’ climate - related risk management practices to inform their investment and voting decisions.764 Because climate -related risks can have material impacts on a registrant’s business, it is important for investors to have information available to them so that they can understand how a registrant identifies, assesses, and manages any such risks . At the same time, we are mindful of commenters’ suggestions , both for this risk management disclosure in particular and climate - related disclosure s more generally, that the Commission promulgate rules that allow registrants to tailor the disclosure of material climate -related risks and related management practices to their own particular facts and circumstances.765 Accordingly, we are adopting a less prescriptive approach that focuses on a description of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks . In doing so, we have sought to avoi d imposing a “ one-size- fits- all” disclosure model 766 that fails to account for differences in industries and businesses and that 762 See, e.g. , letters from Chamber; IECA; and J. Weinstein. 763 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a). As noted in section II. D.2.c above, we have moved the disclosure requirement concerning a registrant’s transition plan to the 17 CFR 229.1502. 764 See, e.g. , letters from Ceres; C2ES; PWHC; SKY Harbor; and WSP. 765 See supra note 730 and accompanying text. 766 See, e.g. , letters from API; Chamber; and SIFMA. could result in disclosure of immaterial information while still eliciting decision -useful information for investors about regis trants’ risk management practices . As a number of commenters indicated, consistent information about a registrant’s management of climate -related risks is vital to informed investment and voting decisions .767 Despite the importance of climate -related risk management information to investors, only a minority of registrants currently include such information in their voluntary climate reports or in their Exchange Act filings .768 We considered comments that the proposed disclosure requirem ents are redundant because existing rules already require disclosure about material risks in annual reports, but we continue to believe that a specific disclosure item focused on managing material climate -related risks is warranted. While registrants may be required to disclose certain climate -related information in filings made with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure requirements, as noted above769 there is a need to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of disclosures about c limate -related risk management for investors given that, as noted above, most r egistrants are not currently including the type of information called for by the final rules in voluntary climate reports or Exchange Act filings .770 We also considered comments that the proposal placed undue emphasis on climate -related risks and , as discussed below, have made a number of changes in response to streamline the requirements and focus on materia l climate - related risks . 767 See supra note 727 and accompanying text. See also Anthesis (stating that the SEC should require the registrant to disclose its process for identifying climate risks with the highest materiality and explain its adaptation/mitigation plan to build resiliency ). 768 See TCFD, 2022 Status Report (Oct. 2022) , available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2022/10/2022- TCFD -Status -Report.pdf (indicating that only approximately one -third of over 1,400 public companies surveyed provided disclosure concerning climate risk management processes in their 2021 re ports). 769 See supra note 727 and accompanying text. 770 See section IV.A.5 . First, in a change from the proposal, w e have added a materiality qualifier to the disclosure item.771 The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks. I ncluding a materiality qualifier addresses the specific concerns expressed by commenters that the proposal would require registrants to disclose this information in a level of detail that would impose undue costs. If a registrant has not identified a material climate -related risk, no disclosure is required. Given the concerns expressed by commenters that there is a wide range of risks that registrants manage as part of their operations, we are persuaded that it is ap propriate to include a materiality qualifier for this aspect of the proposal to help ensure that the final rule elicits decision -useful information for investors without imposing an undue burden on registrants and placing undue emphasis on climate -related risks that are not material . Similarly , to address the concerns of commenters that the proposed risk management disclosure provision would require registrants to address items that might not be relevant to their particular business or industry,772 we have removed several prescriptive elements from the final rule. Those proposed provisions that we are not adopting would have required a registrant, w hen describing any processes for identifying and assessing climate -related risks, to disclose, as applicable, how the registrant: • Determines the relative significance of climate -related risks compared to other risks; • Considers existing or likely regulatory requirements or policies, such as GHG emissions limits, when identifying climate -related risks; 771 See supra note 730 and accompanying text. 772 See supra note 730 and accompanying text. • Considers shifts in customer or counterparty preferences, technological changes, or changes in market prices in assessing potential transition risks; and • Determines the materiality of climate -related risks . Instead, the final rule will allow a registrant , when describing its processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risk s, to determine which factors are most significant , and therefore should be addressed, based on its particular facts and circumstances , which may include information on the items listed above . Commenters that supported the proposal stated that a meaningful description of the processes underlying climate risk management is necessary to enable investors to evaluate registrants’ climate risk management pract ices as part of their investment decisions. T he final rule will elicit disclosures that offer a more complete picture of the management of material climate -related risks while also mitigating concerns that the proposed rule c ould unnecessarily elevate climate- related risk above other important matters and give rise to competitive harm and increased litigation risk for registrants . The final rule will also promote more consistent and comparable disclosure of registrants’ climate -related risk management practices than is current ly available from voluntary reporting and , as these provisions of the final rules more closely align with the TCFD, they may limit costs for those registrants who are familiar with reporting under this framework. The final rule provides that a registrant should address , as applicable, how it identifies whether it has incurred or is reasonably likely to incur a material physical or transition risk.773 This provis ion is similar to the proposed rule that would have required a registrant to describe its 773 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(1). processes for identifying a climate -related risk.774 The final rule substitutes the more specific terms “physical risk or transition risk ” for “ climate -related risk ” to clarify and simplify the requirement since Item 1500 defines climate -related risk to encompass physical and transition risks . In addition, because the processes and factors that a registrant may use to identify the two types of risks may differ in certain respects , or in some cases a registrant may face one and not the other kind of risk, this change should elicit more relevant information for investors .775 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule also provides that a registrant should address , as applicable, how it: • Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk;776 and • Prioritizes whether to address the climate -related risk.777 The final rules will help investors to understand the processes that a registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing climate -related risks , consistent with the feedback of many commenters .778 In this regard, commenters further indicated that information concerning how a registrant prioritizes climate -related risks vis -à-vis other risks that the registrant is managing would be particularly useful .779 We are not, however, retaining the proposed requirement to disclose how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high priority risks . In response to the concerns expressed by sever al commenters,780 we have removed this proposed disclosure item t o 774 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E.1. 775 See TCFD, supra note 332, at 13 -14 (providing different tables (Tables D2 and D3) outlining the identification and assessment approaches for transition risks and physical risks). 776 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(2). 777 See 17 CFR 229.1503(a)(3). 778 See supra note 747 and accompanying text. 779 See supra note 749 and accompanying text. 780 See supra note 733 and 734 and accompanying text. reduce the prescriptiveness of the risk management disclosure requirement and streamline this requirement, as we have done with other areas of the final rule s. Furthermore, in response to one commenter who supported the proposal but cautioned against an overly broad application,781 we confirm that the final rules do not require registrants to speculate in their disclosures about future restructurings, write -downs, or impairments related to climate risk management. The flexibility afforded by the final rules also helps address the point made by the same commenter that the proposed disclosure item should not compel registrant s to disclose trade secrets or confidential business information. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose whether and how any of the processes it has described for identifying, assessing, and managing the material climate -related risk have been integrated into the registrant’s overall risk management system or processes.782 As some commenters noted, information about how a registrant integrates its clima te risk management processes into its overall risk management system is important to help investors understand and assess the effectiveness of those climate risk management processes . 783 Mandating this disclosure , therefore , will allow investors to make be tter informed decisions about the overall risk profile of their investment in the registrant and provide a measure from which they can evaluate similarly situated companies.784 We are not adopting the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose , if it has a separate board or management committee responsible for assessing and managing climate- 781 See e.g. , letter from BOA. 782 See 17 CFR 229.1503(b). 783 See supra note 753 and accompanying text. 784 See, e.g. , letter from SKY Harbor. related risks, how that committee interacts with the registrant’s board or management committee governing risks. Several commenters stated that the y do not have dedicated board or management committees for managing climate -related risks ,785 or asserted that including such prescriptive elements in the final rule could lead to boilerplate disclosure .786 Having considered these comments, and in light of our overall aim to reduce the prescriptiveness of the proposed requirements, we are not including this disclosure item in the final rule . We believe the other disclosure items we are adopting will still provide investors with decision -useful information about how registrants manage their material climate -related risks. Finally, as noted above,787 we are not adopting the proposed rule that allowed but did not require registrants to describe any processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate - related opportunities when responding to any of the provisions in the risk management section.788 As with other voluntary disclosure, registrants may elect to include such disclosure. While we recognize the recommendation of some commenters that such disclosure be mandatory, consistent with the rule proposal, we have determined to treat disclosure regarding climate -related opportunities as optional , among other reasons, to allay any anti -competitive concerns that might arise from a requirement to disclose a particular business opportunity. 789 785 See, e.g. , letter from BIO. 786 See, e.g. , letter from Chamber. 787 See supra section II.C.1.c. 788 See 17 CFR 229.1503(c). 789 See Proposing Release, s ection II.A.1. commenter stated that it did not believe it was necessary for companies to disclose the amount of energy represented by REC s, their nature , or the location of the underlying projects.846 3. Final Rule a. The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b) , and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant’s climate -related targets or goals in order to understand and assess the registrant ’s transition risk strategy and how the registrant is manag ing the material impacts of its identified climate -related risks . We recognize, however, as some commenters indicated , that an overly broad requirement to disclose any climate -related target or goal, even one that is meant for preliminary, internal planning purposes and that is not yet material, could impose a compliance burden on registrants that may outweigh its benefi t to investors .848 Conditioning the targets and goals disclosure requirement on the target s or goal s being material will help to address this concern by focusing the requirement on the information that is most likely to be decision- useful for investors . If a registrant sets an internal target or goal that materially affect s or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition ( e.g., due to material expenditures or operational changes that are required to achieve the target or goal), then investors should have access to information about that target or goal to help them 846 See letter from CEMEX. 847 See 17 CFR 229.1504(a). 848 See supra notes 823 and 828 and accompanying text. understand the financial impacts and assess th e registrant’s transition risk management . While some commenters recomm ended that the Commission require the disclosure only of targets or goals that are both material and publicly announced,849 we decline to follow this suggestion. Such a condition would enable a registrant to keep non- public an internal target or goal that is material, which would fail to protect investors by potentially precluding their access to information that is important to make informed investment and voting decisions . We reemphasize, however, that a registrant is not required to disclose an internal target or goal that is not material. In addition, we decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters that the targets and goals disclosure requirement should only be triggered by the board’s or CEO’s formal adoption of the target or goal .850 Such a provision would deprive investors of material information for procedural reasons unrelated to the importance of the information to investors . Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the final rules are intended to elicit material climate - related disclosures for investors and not to influence governance practices regarding climate-related matters. Because registrants may have different processes for setting targets or goals, we believe that materiality is a better threshold for di sclosure of targets or goals than basing the disclosure requirement on an internal process that may differ from company to company. Similarly, a lthough one commenter recommended that the Commission require the disclosure only of targets or goals related to a registrant’s GHG emissions, 851 we decline to follow this recommendation. I nvestors need information about all of a registrant’s material 849 See supra note 829 and accompanying text. 850 See supra note 820 and accompanying text. 851 See supra note 807 and accompanying text. climate -related targets and goals in order to assess the impact of such targets and goals on a registrant’s overall business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects . Although the particular non -GHG emissions target or goal to be disclosed will depend on a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances , to the extent such targets or goals are material, a registrant must disclose them. To simplify the targets and goals disclosure requirement and avoid implying any topical focus regarding the particular targets or goals that should be discussed, we have eliminated from the final rule the parenthetical “e.g., the reduction of GHG emissions or regarding energy usage, water usage, or revenues from low -carbon products .” We also decline to follow the recommendations of some commenters to include provisions that specifically require the disclo sure of targets or goals related to mitigation of impacts on local communities or that concern human capital management goals.852 The final rule is intended to elicit disclosure of any climate -related target or goal that has materially affected or is reaso nably likely to materially affect a registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. Accordingly, any target or goal meeting the conditions of the final rule (including that it is material) will need to be disclosed regardless of the particular issues it address es, if that target or goal is considered climate -related in the registrant’s particular circumstances and if achieving such target or goal would materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition. We note that a registrant may voluntarily disclose additional information that is not required to be disclosed under the final rule (and not part of a target or goal) but that is related to the mitigation of climate -related risks. Similar to the proposed rule, with some modifications as discussed below , the final rule (Item 1504(b)) will require a registrant that is disclosing its targets and goals pursuant to Item 852 See supra note 806 and accompanying text. 1504 to provide any additional information or explanation necessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the target or goal, includ ing, as applicable, a description of: • The scope of activities included in the target; • The unit of measurement; • The defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved, and whether the time horizon is based on one or more goals established by a climate -related treaty, law, regulation, policy, or organization; • If the registrant has established a baseline for the target or goal, the defi ned baseline time period and the means by which progress will be tracked; and • A qualitative description of how the registrant intends to meet its climate -related targets or goals.853 These disclosures will allow investors to better understand a registrant ’s targets or goals and how it intends to achieve them, which will help investors better assess a registrant’s transition risks and make more informed investment and voting decisions . In order to address the concern of some commenters that the proposed ta rgets and goals disclosure provision was too prescriptive and would impose a costly compliance burden without necessarily resulting in material information ,854 the final rule has been revised so that the listed items are non- exclusive examples of additional information or explanation that a registrant must disclose only if 853 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b). 854 See supra note 823 and accompanying text. necessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the target or goal .855 To further streamline the targets and goals disclosure requirement, the final rules do not include “emissions” in the list of information that must be disclosed if necessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of a target or goal. If a registrant has set a material target or goal to reduce emissions, it will be required to disclose this when explaining the scope of activities included in the target. We also have eliminated the proposed disclosure item regarding whether a target is absolute or intensity -based because this information will likely be elicited by other required disclosure , such as the unit of measurement pertaining to the target or goal. 856 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires discl osure , as applicable, of how the registrant intends to meet its climate -related targets or goals.857 However, in order to help address the concern of some commenters that the proposed rule could result in the disclosure of an excessive amount of detail, the final rule specifies that th is discussion of prospective activities need only be qualitative. In addition, we are eliminating the proposed example that, f or a target or goal regarding net GHG emissions reduction, the discussion could include a strategy to increase energy efficiency, transition to lower carbon products, purchase carbon offsets or RECs, or engage in carbon removal and carbon storage. 858 This will avoid any misperception that these are required items of disclosure. T he final rule leaves it up to the registrant to determine what 855 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b). 856 In addition, as discussed below in s ection II.H, elimination of this proposed disclosure requirement is consistent with our removal of the proposed requirement to disclose a registrant’s GHG emissions m etrics in intensity terms in addition to absolute terms. 857 See 17 CFR 229.1504(b) (5). 858 See Proposing Release, s ection II.I. specific factors to highlight as part of the qualitative description of how it plans to meet its targets or goals . We are also not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by the regis trant. We agree with commenters that stated that this disclosure item is not necessary because, if a registrant has set an interim target that is material, it will likely be included in the registrant’s discussion of its plan to achieve its targets or goa ls. 859 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule (Item 1504(c)) will require a registrant to disclose any progress toward meeting the target or goal and how such progress has been achieved.860 Also similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will req uire the registrant to update this disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or goals. 861 We are adopting t his updating requirement for substantially the same reasons we are adopting the updating requirement with respect to the transition plan disclosure required under Item 1502(e) , 862 including because it will better enable investors to monitor impacts on the registrant as it attempts to meet its targets or goals. Relatedly, the final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business , results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal.863 This disc ussion must include quantitative and qualitative 859 See letter from Unilever. 860 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c). 861 See id. 862 See supra notes 508-514 and accompanying text. In addition, as with the required transition plan disclosure, no update about targets and goals would be required to be disclosed if the underlying target s or goals are not required to be disclosed (e.g., because th e target or goal is no longer material ). 863 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c) (1). disclosure of any material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal , 864 consistent with the suggestion of some commenters.865 We have added these latter provisions because, as commenters noted, a company’s climate commitments , and progress in relation to its commitments , may materially impact its business, outlook, operating expenditures, capital expenditures, liquidity, and other capital resources , which is why investors seek and need information about such material expenditures and other material financial impacts related to its targets and goals . 866 As discussed in more detail below,867 a number of commenters who supported the proposed expenditures disclosures in Regulation S -X indicated that such disclosure would help investors understand a registrant’s ability to meet its climate -related targets and goals.868 We recognize commenters ’ concerns about registrants’ abilities to identify, attribute, and quantify the impact of transition activities i n the financial statements.869 We believe that providing for this disclosure in the context of Item 1504 information on progress towards targets or goals appropriately balances investors’ need for this information with commenters ’ concerns about implementation challenges. As discussed above, 870 with respect to concerns raised in the 864 See 17 CFR 229.1504(c)(2). 865 See supra notes 816 and 817 and accompanying text . 866 See, e.g. , letters from Amazon; Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; and PwC. 867 See infra s ections II.K.3.b and c . 868 See infra notes 1967 and accompanying text. 869 See infra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text. 870 See supra section s II.D. 1.c. and II. D.2.c for discussion of similar material expenditures disclosure requirement, respectively, as part of a registrant’s transition plan disclosure under Item 1502(e) and from activities to mitigate or adapt to climate -related risks disclosed pursuant to Item 1502(b)( 4) under Item 1502(d) of Regulation S -K. To the extent that there is any overlapping disclosure of material expenditures context of the proposed Regulation S -X amendments about registrant s’ abilities to disaggregate the portion of an expenditure that is directly related to transition activities , under the final rules, registrants w ill have flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of any disclosed expenditure and how it is a direct result of progress under a disclosed target or goal. In addition, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright- line thre shold, as was proposed for the Regulation S -X amendments, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. Additionally, when considering which expenditures related to progress under a disclosed target or goal are material over the relevant period and therefore require disclosure, registrants should consider whether overall expenditures related to progress under a disclosed target or goal are material in the aggregate and, if so, provide appropri ate disclosure. Finally, to the extent that disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the target or goal is disclosed in response to Rule 14-02(h) of Regulation S -X, a registrant would be able to cross -reference to such disclosure . 871 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule will permit a registrant to provide the required targets and goals disclosure as part of its discussion pursuant to Item 1502 regarding its transition plan or when otherwise discus sing material impacts of climate -related risks on its business strategy or business model. 872 A registrant will also be permitted to provide the required targets in response to these Items, to avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment , such disclosure is most appropriate, and then cross- reference to this disclosure when responding to the other Items. 871 See supra note 521. 872 See 17 CFR 229.1504(a). and goals disclosure in its risk management discussion pursuant to Item 1503.873 This provision will help to eliminate redundancies in the s ubpart 1500 disclosure. Similar to Items 1502(d)(2) and 1502(e)(2), and for similar reasons, we are providing a phase in for compliance with the Item 1504(c) (2) disclosure requirement . A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets under the Science Based Targets Initiative, or the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. 875 As we similarly noted when declining to follow a recommendation to broaden transition risk disclosure, the targets and goals disclosure requirement we are adopting is consistent with the TCFD framework, which provides flexibility in terms of whic h tools or methods a registrant chooses to use , and therefore will limit the targets and goals compliance burden for those registrants that are already familiar with the TCFD framework. 876 A registrant may elect to provide disclosure regarding these additi onal items, but they are not required items of disclosure. b. The Carbon Offsets and RECs Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(d)) Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule includes a disclosure requirement about a registrant’s use of carbon offsets or RECs (Item 1504(d)) . Unlike the proposed rule, however, a 873 See id. 874 See section II.O.3. 875 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text. 876 See supra s ection II.C.1.c. registrant will be required to disclose certain information about the carbon offsets or RECs only if they have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve climate- related targets or goals .877 We have added a materiality qualifier to the final rule to address the concern of commenters that the proposed disclosure requirement could result in detailed offsets or RECs information that is of little use to investors. 878 Under the final rule, registrants will need to make a determination, based upon their specific facts and circumstances, about the importance of such carbon offsets and credits to t heir overall transition plan and provide disclosure accordingly. If carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve climate -related targets or goals, then, similar to the proposed rule, the registrant wi ll be required to disclose : the amount of carbon avoidance, reduction or removal represented by the offsets or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the REC s; the nature and source of the offsets or RECs ; 879 a description and location of t he underlying projects ; any registries or other authentication of the offsets or RECs ; and the cost of the offsets or RECs .880 Information about the source, value, underlying projects, and authentication of the carbon offsets or RECs will help investors evaluate the role of these instruments in a registrant’s climate -related strategy and the impacts on its business . For example, understanding the role that carbon offsets or RECs play in a registrant’s climate -related business strategy can help investors 877 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). 878 See, e.g. , letters from Beller et al .; and J. Weinstein. 879 The nature of an offset refers to whether it represents carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal. The nature of an REC refers primarily to whether it is bundled or unbundled. The source of an offset or REC refers to the party that has issued the offset or REC . Commenters stated that investors need such detailed information about offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a registrant’s transition risk strategy and management of climate -related impacts on its business . See supra notes 831-834 and accompanying text. 880 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). At the recommendation of commenters, see supra note 835, to clarify that an offset can represent carbon avoidance, in addition to carbon reduction or removal, we have added “avoidance” to the definition of c arbon offset . See 17 CFR 229.1500 . assess the potential risks and financial impacts of pursuing that strategy. Relatedly, a registrant that relies on carbon offsets or RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve its targets or goals might need to consider whether fluctuating supply or demand, and corresponding variability of price, related to c arbon offsets or RECs, pr esents an additional material risk that is required to be disclosed when discussing its plan to achieve such target or goal pursuant the requirements of subpart 1500. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant’s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant’s business and financial condition. Also , at the recommendation of commenters, we have added the nature of the carbon offsets or RECs as a disclosure item in addition to the source of the offsets or RECs. 883 This addition will help investors understand whether a purchased offset represents carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal, and whether a n REC is bundled or unbundled. Requiring the disclosure of 881 A carbon avoidance occurs, e.g. , when a company protects a forest from deforestation. A carbon reduction occurs when emissions are reduced, e.g. , when a company switches from the use of fossil -fuel based energy to the use of wind or solar power. A carbon removal occurs when CO 2 is drawn out of the atmosphere and sequestered, e.g., by carbon capture and storage technology. See, e.g. , letter from Ceres; and Ceres, Evaluating the Use o f Carbon Credits (Mar. 1, 2022) , available at https://www.ceres.org/resou rces/reports/evaluating -use-carbon -credits . 882 See, e.g. , letters from Amer. Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; BCSE; and Ceres . 883 See, e.g. , letters from Amer. Clean Power ; and IETA. the source of the offset or REC will help investors deter mine whether the offset has met certain criteria of an established standard -setting body,884 and whether the REC originated from and met the standards of a compliance market or is instead derived from a more loosely regulated voluntary market.885 These fact ors can affect the value and cost of the offsets and RECs and their attendant risks. For example, as one commenter noted, a market that develops increased demand for carbon removal offsets, either because of new regulation or stricter voluntary standards for net -zero targets, could result in a significant increase in offset prices , potential supply bottlenecks , and increased transition risk for registrants that assumed the continued availability and abundance of cheaper offsets .886 One commenter who objec ted to the proposed offsets and RECs disclosure requirement asserted that the Commission lack s statutory authority to regulate offsets and RECs.887 We disagree with that commenter ’s characterization of the rule. In requiring the disclosure of certain information about a registrant’s use of offsets or RECs when such use is a material component of the registrant’s plan to achieve a target or goal that is required to be disclosed, we are not advocating for or against the use of offsets or RECs generally, or f or or against the use of certain types of offsets or RECs. Nor are we substantively regulating their use. As previously mentioned, the final rules, including those pertaining to the use of offsets or RECs, are neutral regarding any strategy that a regist rant may choose to manage a material climate- related risk. Instead, like the other climate -related disclosure rules we are adopting, the final rule regarding 884 See, e.g. , letter of IETA (referencing the Carbon Offset Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”) market established by the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) and adopted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority). 885 See, e.g. , letter from Amer. Clean Power. 886 See letter from Carb onPlan. 887 See letter from J. Weinstein. the disclosure of offsets or RECs is intended to provide investors with the decision -useful infor mation they need to understand a registrant’s strategy to mitigate or adapt to the realized or reasonably likely financial impacts of a material climate -related risk. H. GHG Emissions Disclosure (Item 1505) 1. Proposed Rule The proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions888 for its most recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements , to the extent such historical GHG emissions data is reasonably availabl e.889 The Commission based the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement on the concept of scopes, which are themselves based on the concepts of direct and indirect emissions, developed by the GHG Protocol. 890 The Commission proposed to require a regis trant to disclose its Scope 1 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the direct GHG emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by a registrant. 891 The Commission also proposed to require a registrant to disclose its Scope 2 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or 888 We proposed to define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO 2”); methane (“CH 4”); nitrous oxide (“N 2O”); nitrogen trifluoride (“NF 3”); hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”); perfluorocarbons (“PFCs”); and sulfur hexafluoride (“SF 6”). The greenhouse gases included in the proposed definition reflect the gases that are currently commonly referenced by international, scientific, and regulatory authorities as having significant climate impacts. This list of constituent gree nhouse gases is consistent with the gases identified by widely used frameworks, such as the Kyoto Protocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the EPA, and the GHG Protocol. See Proposing Release, section II.G.1.a. 889 See id . 890 Direct emissions are GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by a registrant, whereas indirect emissions are GHG emissions that result from the activities of the registrant but occur at sources not owned or c ontrolled by the registrant. See World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) , available at https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg -protocol -revised.pdf . 891 See Proposing Release , section II.G.1.a. the Exchange Act annual report.1001 Commenters recommended varying deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10- Q for the registrant’s first1004 or second fiscal quarter.1005 Commenters further stated that providing a later deadline for GHG emissions disclosure would better align with the GHG emissions reporting required by other administrative agencies.1006 In addition, commenters stated that providing a later deadline for GH G emissions disclosure would be preferable to the proposed use of a fourth quarter estimate, which would likely require an additional submission that would be burdensome for registrants and potentially confusing for investors. 1007 3. Final Rule a. Overview of th e GHG Emissions Disclosure Requirement As many commenters have indicated, investors view information about a registrant’s GHG emissions , including its Scope s 1 and 2 emissions, as a central measure and indicator of the registrant’s exposure to transition risk as well as a useful tool for assessing its management of transition risk and understanding its progress towards a registrant’s own climate -related targets no later than the due date for the Form 10- Q for the second quarter in the subsequent fiscal year); and SIFMA (recommending inclusion in the Form 10- Q for the second quarter in the subsequent fiscal year or in a Form 6 -K furnished at a comparable time). 1001 See letter from Cleary Gottlieb. 1002 See, e.g. , letters from Blackrock; and GM (suggesting alignment with GHG emissions reporting de adline of other agencies (90- 120 days after fiscal year -end)). 1003 See, e.g. , letters from ACLI; Can. Bankers; Chamber; HP; Nareit; NMA; Soc. Corp. Gov.; Sullivan Cromwell (recommending 180 days after fiscal year -end deadline for all climate disclosures). 1004 See, e.g. , letter from ABA. 1005 See, e.g. , letters from NAM (recommending that GHG emissions be disclosed in separate report that is aligned with due date for 2 nd fiscal quarter Form 10 -Q); and SIFMA. 1006 See, e.g. , letter s from ABA ; Chamber; GM; HP; NAM; NMA; and Soc. Corp. Gov. 1007 See, e.g. , letter s from ABA ; Can. Bankers; Chamber; GM; HP; Microsoft; NAM; Nareit; and Soc. Corp. Gov. or goals .1008 Because s uch information can be necessary to inform an investor’s unders tanding of the overall impact of transition risk and related targets and goals on a registrant ’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects , the final rules include a Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure requirement (Item 1505) , although modified from the rule proposal . We recognize commenters’ concerns about the potentially high cost of compliance associated with the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement, including Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1009 as well as concerns about th e current availability and reliability of the underlying data for Scope 3 emissions .1010 To help address these concerns, instead of requiring, as proposed, the disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by all registrants regardless of their materiality , the final rules will require the disclosure of Scope 1 emissions and /or Scope 2 em issions metrics1011 by LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs , on a phased in basis,1012 if such emissions are material.1013 1008 See, e.g. , letters from AGs of Cal. et al.; AllianceBernstein; CalPERS; CalSTRS; IAA; Miller /Howard; Morningstar; Trillium; and Wellington Mgmt. 1009 See supra note s 933 to 935 and accompanying text. 1010 See supra note s 924-925 and accompanying text. 1011 The concept of scopes was developed as part of the GHG Protocol. See World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute, GHG Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) , available at https://ghgprotocol.org/s ites/default/files/standards/ghg -protocol - revised.pdf . We understand that some registrants may measure their GHG emissions pursuant to other well- established standards, such as ISO 14064 and related ISO standards, which do not refer to scopes. For the purposes of the final rules, we have defined “Scope 1 emissions” and “Scope 2 emissions,” respectively, as a registrant’s direct emissions and indirect emissions largely from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity consumed by the registrant’s operations . We intend these definitions to include substantially similar emissions as those measured pursuant to the ISO standards. Accordingly, registrants have flexibility to leverage standards of their choice in calculating and disclosing GHG emissions metrics required by the final rules, including the GHG Protocol or relevant ISO standards, or other standards that may be established over time. 1012 As discussed in s ection II.O below, LAFs will have a one -year transition period before they are required to comply with the final rule’s GHG emissions disclosure requirement s. AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs will be required to comply with the final rule’s GHG emissions disclosure requirements two years following the GHG emissions compliance date for LAFs. 1013 See 17 CFR 229.1505(a) (1). To the extent Scope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure are required under the final rules, 17 CFR 230.409 or 17 CFR 240.12b- 21, which provide accommodations for information that is unknown and not reasonabl y available, would be available if its conditions are met. As commenters have noted, some registrants already measure their GHG emissions, typically Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1014 and some use the data to manage their transition risk exposure or monitor their progress towards achieving climate -related targets and goals .1015 Many other registrants, however, have determined that climate is not a material risk to their business, or are not currently measuring their GHG emissions.1016 In balancing these considerations, we are not mandating Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosures from all registra nts. Rather, under the final rule , if either or both of those categories of GHG emissions are material, and the registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than an SRC or EGC , it must disclose its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions metrics .1017 As we stated when discussing a registrant’s determination of material impacts of climate -related risks , we intend that a registrant apply traditional notions of materiality under the Federal securities laws when evaluating whether its Scopes 1 and/or 2 emi ssions are material.1018 Thus, materiality is not determined merely by the amount of these emissions. Rather, a s with other materiality determinations under the Federal securities laws and Regulation S -K, the guiding principle for this determination is whe ther a reasonable investor would consider the disclosure of an item of information, in this case the registrant’s Scope 1 emissions and/or its Scope 2 emissions, 1014 See supra note 916 and accompanying text. 1015 See id . 1016 Although the TCFD has reported a significant increase in the number of companies that have publicly disclosed their GHG emissions across the globe in recent years, a minority of North American and U.S. companies have done so. The TCFD recently reported that only 30% of North American companies surveyed reported their Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions in 2021. See TCFD, supra note 768. 1017 If a registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than a n SRC or EGC and its Scope 1 emissions are material but its Scope 2 emissions are not material, then, under the final rules, the registrant must disclose its Scope 1 emissions and is not required to disclose its Scope 2 emissions (and vice versa if its Scope 2 emissions are material but its Scope 1 emissions are not). If a registrant’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions both are material, then it must disclose both categories of emissions. 1018 See, e.g. , supra note 381 and accompanying text. important when making an investment or voting decision or such a reasonable investor would view omission of the disclosure as having significantly altered the total mix of info rmation made available. A registrant’s Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions may be material because the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to allow investors to understand whether those emissions are significant enough to subject the registrant to a transition risk that will or is reasonably likely to materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition in the short - or long- term. For exampl e, where a registrant faces a material transition risk that has manifested as a result of a requirement to report its GHG emissions metrics under foreign or s tate law1019 because such emissions are currently or are reasonably likely to be subject to additional regulatory burdens through increased taxes or financial penalties , the registrant should consider whether such emissions metrics are material under the final rules . A registrant’s GHG emissions may also be material if the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to enable investors to understand whether the registrant has made progress toward achieving a target or goal or a transition plan that the registrant is required to disclose under the final rules. Conversely, the fact that a registrant is ex posed to a material transition risk does not necessarily result in its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions being de facto material to the registrant. For example, a registrant could reasonably determine that it is exposed to a material transition risk for reasons other than its GHG emissions, such as a new law or regulation that restricts the 1019 See supra section II.A.3 (discussing adoption of the ISSB climate disclosure standard and the foreign jurisdictions that intend to implement the standard and California’s recently adopted laws requiring certain large corporations to disclose their GHG emissions metr ics and their climate -related financial risks). sale of its products based on the technology it uses, not directly based on its emissions.1020 Such a risk may trigger disclosure under other provi sions of s ubpart 1500 but may not necessarily trigger disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions information under Item 1505.1021 This revised approach to GHG emissions disclosure will provide investors with information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions while address ing concerns regarding the disclosure of GHG emissions data that may be immaterial. This approach will also limit the compliance costs of the final rules, as it will not require disclosure of GHG emissions data where such data is immaterial. B asing the GHG emissions disclosure requirement on traditiona l notions of materiality , which ar e fundamental to U.S. securities laws and the Commission’s securities regulation, is more appropriate than a requirement that relies on GHG emissions disclosure law s or regulations required by other Federal agencies and foreign or state jurisdictions , as one commenter recommended .1022 Those other laws or regulations may be adopted to serve other purposes and may be presented without the additional disclosures that supplement the “ total mix ” of information investors need for context and to understand why the GHG emissions information is material. We acknowledge, however, that registrants could incur costs to assess and monitor the materiality of their emissions, even in situations in which they ultimately determine that they do not need to provide disclosure, and that for some registrants these costs could be significant, especially if firms are not already tracking this information for internal purposes.1023 Mindful of 1020 See, e.g. , Simone Foxman, The Electric Revolution Is Coming for Your Lawn Mower , Bloomberg (Nov. 20, 2023), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023 -11-20/gas -lawn -care- ban-in-california - tests-electric -leaf-blower -appeal . 1021 See id. 1022 See letter from Grundfest. 1023 See infra section IV. C.2.e. these costs, we are further limiting the GHG emissions disclosure requirement to LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs and on a phased in basis. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources and time to prepare for what we acknowledge could be a significant additional compliance obligation.1024 We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. Nevertheless, mindful of the attendant costs, we believe that the final rules present an appropriate means to achieve the primary benefits of GHG emissions disclosure , namely: providing investors with material metrics that will aid in the assessment of transition risk for those registrants that have identified a material climate risk ; and facilitating investors ’ evaluation of a registrant’s progress towards achieving a material target or goal and the attendant effects on the registrant’s business, resul ts of operations, or financial condition. While the final GHG emissions disclosure provision will not apply to as many registrants or achieve the same level of comparability as may have been achieved under the proposed rules, on balance, we believe that, coupled with the other disclosures required under subpart 1500 and the structured data requirements of the final rules, investors will have sufficient information to assess the operational and financial impact of transition risks and strategies on registrants and compare such impacts across registrants . b. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of the Underlying Methodolo gies and Assumptions In a change from the rule proposal , which would have required the disclosure of a registrant’s GHG emissions both disaggregated by each constituent GHG and in the aggregate , 1024 As discussed below, neither EGCs nor SRCs will be required to disclose their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions under the final rules. See 17 CFR 229.1505(a)(3) (i). whether, instead of, or in addition to, such management assessment, it should require the registrant to obtain an attestation report from a GHG emissions attestation provider that covers the effectiveness of such GHG emissions controls. 1193 Some commenters stated that the Commission should not require an attestation report from a GHG emissions provider that covers the effectiveness of such GHG emissions controls. 1194 One commenter questioned the value of a separate attestation report on cont rols at the moment because it does not believe there is a “specific standard for . . . controls around non- financial data” that “takes into account the specific subject matter expertise needed in the internal control process.”1195 c. Final Rules (Item 1506) After considering comments, we are adopting final rules (Item 1506(a)( 1)) that require a registrant, including a foreign private issuer, that is required to provide Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure pursuant to Item 1505 to include an attestation report covering the disclosure of its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions i n the relevant filing.1196 However, as discussed in greater detail below, we made a number of modifications to the proposal to address certain concerns raised by commenters. 1193 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1194 See, e.g. , letters from CEME X; CFA Institute (stating that the issue could be revisited by the Commission in the future); and Grant Thornton. 1195 See letter from ERM CVS. 1196 See 17 CFR 229.1506. Consistent with the Commission’s statement in the Proposing Release, in order to attest to Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure, a GHG emissions attestation provider will need to include in its evaluation relevant contextual information. See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. In particular, under the final rules, the attestation provider will be required to evaluate the registrant’s compliance with (i) Item 1505(a), which includes presentation requirements (e.g., disaggregation of any constituent gas if individually material), and (ii) the disclosure requirements in Item 1505(b) regarding methodology, organization boundary, and operational boundary. See infra section II.I. 3.c for further discussion of the criteria against which the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure are measured or evaluated. Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure:1197 Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Disclosure Compliance Date Limited Assurance Compliance Date Reasonable Assurance Compliance Date LAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033 AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs) Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A AFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report under the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1) (i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. 1200 The final rules do not require an AF to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level. Consistent with the proposed rules, and with the lack of a requirement to disclose Scope 3 emissi ons under the final rules, no registrants will be required to obtain assurance over Scope 3 emissions under the final rules. Furthermore, as explained in greater detail below in s ection II.L.3, the final rules, including Item 1506, will not apply to a pri vate compan y that is a party to a 1197 See infra section II.O.3 for a detailed d iscussion of compliance dates for the final rules. 1198 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a). 1199 See 17 CFR 229.1505. See also supra section II.H.3. 1200 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1). business combination transaction, as defined by Securities Act Rule 165(f), involving a securities offering registered on Form S -4 or F-4. As discussed above, a significant number of commenters supported the Commission’s proposal to require certain registrants to obtain mandatory assurance over GHG emissions disclosure.1201 Many of these commenters agreed with the Commission that mandatory assurance would improve the accuracy, comparability, and consistency of registrants’ GHG emissions disclosure. 1202 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, obtaining assurance over GHG emissions disclosure provides investors with an additional degree of reliability regarding not only the figures that are disclosed, but also the key assumptions, methodologies, and data sources the registrant used to arrive at those figures. 1203 The Commission has long recognized the important role played by an independent auditor in contributing to the reliability of financial reporting.1204 Studie s suggest that investors have greater confidence in information that has been assured, particularly when it is assured at the reasonable assurance level,1205 and that high quality audits reduce the cost of capital,1206 which may benefit both registrants and investors. Similarly, studies of ESG -related assurance, which is typically provided at a limited assurance level, have found benefits such as credibility 1201 See supra note 1105 and accompanying text. 1202 See supra note 1106 and accompanying text. 1203 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1204 See Qualifications of Accountants , Release No. 33 -10876 (Oct. 16, 2020) [85 FR 80508, 80508 (Dec. 22, 2020)].

We considered the view expressed by some commenters that there is no reason to treat GHG emissions disclosures differently than other disclosures located outs ide of the financial statements, which do not require assurance.1210 Although we recognize that registrants may provide quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements that is not subject to any assurance requirement, a s explained in the Proposi ng Release,1211 and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters,1212 GHG emissions disclosures are unique in that many companies currently voluntarily seek third- party assurance over their climate- related disclosures, and commenters, including investor s, have expressed a particular need for assurance over GHG 1207 See, e.g. , Ryan J. Casey, et al., Understanding and Contributing to the Enigma of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Assurance in the United States , 34 Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory 97, 122 (Feb. 2015) (finding that corporate social responsibility (“C SR”) assurance results in lower cost -of-capital along with lower analyst forecast errors and dispersion, and that financial analysts find related CSR reports to be more credible when independently assured).

Berg. 1208 See also IOSC O, Report on International Work to Develop a Global Assurance Framework for Sustainability -related Corporate Reporting ( Mar. 2023), available at https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD729.pdf (observing “growing demand among investors for high- quality assurance over some sustainability -related information to enhance the reliability of corporate reporting”). 1209 See supra notes 1116 and 1121 and accompanying text. 1210 See supra note 1128 and accompanying text. 1211 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1212 See supra notes 1114 and 1106 and accompanying text. emissions disclosures. Current voluntary assurance practices have been varied and this fragmentation has diminished the comparability of assurance provided. Prescribing a minimum level of assuran ce required for AFs and LAFs over their Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions in the final rules, along with minimum requirements for the GHG emissions attestation provider and the engagement, will enhance comparability and consistency with respect to assurance over GHG emissions disclosures. A few commenters stated that it is unnecessary to mandate assurance because there are existing incentives for accuracy in connection with corporate disclosures, such as the Commission staff ’s filing review process or the possibility of Commission enforcement actions or private litigation. 1213 While it is true that there are existing incentives for companies to provide accurate information to investors, these incentives do not provide the same benefits that assurance will pr ovide under the final rules. Although the desire to avoid an enforcement action or private litigation has a deterrent effect on registrants, such proceedings generally serve to adjudicate claims after investors have allegedly received inaccurate or misleading disclosures. In contrast, the assurance requirement in the final rules will require an independent third- party to provide a check on the accuracy and completeness of a registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure before the information is provided to invest ors, which as explained above, will likely result in additional benefits such as lower cost of equity capital and lower analyst forecast errors. 1214 Furthermore, although the Commission staff ’s filing review process serves a valuable compliance function tha t contributes to investor protection, it is not designed to provide assurance, and certainly not for every filing. We note that, despite the existence and benefits of 1213 See supra note 1119. 1214 See supra note 1207. the filing review process, the Commission requires annual financial statements to be audited and has adopted other rules requiring an expert to review and provide conclusions on other specialized quantitative data that is provided outside of the financial statements to enhance its reliability. 1215 than attestation standards and practices for GHG emissions. Nevertheless, as noted above, the practice of providing assurance over GHG emissions is far from nascent and is now expected by many market participants.1218 Several commenters urged the Commission to adopt the verification process for GHG reporting used by the EPA in lieu of the proposed assurance requirements.1219 Although we considered the EPA’s multi- step verification process , given the differences in the Commission’s and EPA’s reporting requirements, the different purposes of the Commission’s and EPA’s respective regulatory regimes, and the benefits of third- party assurance, we determined that independent, third- party assurance is a more appropriate model for the final rules.1220 1218 As discussed above, a number of jurisdictions have undertaken efforts to obtain more consistent, comparable, and reliable climate- related information for investors, see supra s ection II.A.3, with certain jurisdictions requiring the disclosure of GHG emissions data along with assurance. See Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance) , available at https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.322.01.0015.01.ENG (requiring companies within its jurisdiction to obtain limited assurance over sustainability reporting and sta ting that the European Commission will perform an assessment to determine if moving from limited to reasonable assurance is feasible for both auditors and companies); SB -253, Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (Oct. 7, 2023), available at https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253 (requiring the California state board to develop and adopt regulations requiring the disclosure of GHG emissions and accompanying assurance engagements beginning with limited assurance and transitioning to reasonable assurance) . In addition, the IAASB issued an exposure draft on Proposed International Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000. See Proposed International Standard on Sustainability Assurance (ISSA) 5000, General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements (Exposure Draft) (Aug. 2, 2023), available at https://www.iaasb.org/publications/proposed -international -standard-sustainability -assurance- 5000 -general -requirements -sustainability (proposing assurance standards for both reasonable and limited assurance engagements) . 1219 See supra note 1126 and accompanying text. 1220 For a summary of the EPA’s multi- step verification process, which includes verification performed by the EPA itself , see EPA Fact Sheet supra note 1126. See also EPA, Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Report Verification, available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017 - 12/documents/ghgrp_verificati on_factsheet.pdf . The comment letter submitted by the EPA notes distinctions in reporting requirements between the Commission’s proposed rules and the EPA’s GHGRP, including that the Commission’s proposal covers publicly traded companies (domestic and international) regardless of their emissions level, while the EPA’s GHGRP covers facilities and GHG and fuel suppliers (located in the U.S. and its territories) that fall into on e or more of forty -one industrial categories and that, in general, emit or supply 25,000 metric tons CO 2 equivalent or more. See letter from EPA . Some commenters urged the Commission to wait before determining whether to adopt a mandatory attestation requir ement for GHG emissions or to adopt final rules that permit registrants to disclose whether they voluntarily obtained attestation and related details instead of mandating assurance.1221 We agree with commenters that requiring registrants to disclose whether they obtained voluntary assurance and related details w ould help those investors that invest in companies that decide to voluntarily obtain assurance understand whether the attestation obtained has enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure, which is why we have included a requirement in the final rules for registrants that are not subject to Item 1505 to provide certain disclosure if the y voluntarily obtain assurance over any voluntary GHG emissions disclosure included in Commission filings.1222 However, requiring AFs and LAFs to obtain assurance over their Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure in accordance with the final rules will result in more investors receiving the important benefits of assurance , including increased confidence in the reliability of, and an improved ability to make informed investment decisions based on, assured GHG emissions disclosure s, which, as discussed above, provide investors with information for assessing a registrant’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 1223 As discussed in greater detail below, the assurance requirements in the final rules are narrowly tailored and limited to a subset of registrants, many of which already obtain assurance services with respect to their GHG emissions disclosures. In addition, we disagree with those commenters that suggested we wait before determining whether to adopt a mandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions. 1224 The phase in periods included in the 1221 See supra notes 1131 and 1132 and accompanying text. 1222 See infra section II.I.5. 1223 See supra s ection II.H.3.a. 1224 See supra note 1131 and accompanying text. final rules should mitigate the concerns of commenters that stated the Commission should wait in order to give registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers more time to prepare for assur ance, or to allow more time for attestation standards or guidance to develop. Consistent with the proposal, the final rules will apply the attestation requirements to AFs and LAFs. 1225 However, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules will exempt SRC s and EGCs from the requirement to obtain an attestation report.1226 Although some commenters urged the Commission to apply the final rules to all registrants,1227 not just AFs and LAFs, our decision to exempt SRCs and EGCs from the assurance requirement is d riven by our decision to exempt these companies from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions, which is discussed in greater detail above. 1228 Since SRCs and EGCs will not be required to disclose GHG emissions, they also will not be required to obtain assurance. Under the final rules, AFs and LAFs will be required to obtain limited assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505 (the GHG emissions disclosure provision). 1229 LAFs will be required to obtain reasonable assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. 1230 In a change from the proposal, AFs will not be required to scale up to reasonable assurance un der the final rules. Although we agree with those commenters that stated that reasonable assurance would provide investors with increased 1225 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a). 1226 SRCs and EGCs that qualified as AFs would have been included within the scope of AFs subject to the requirement to obtain an attestation report under the proposed rules. 1227 See supra note 1135 and accompanying text. 1228 See supra s ection II.H.3. 1229 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1)(i), (ii). 1230 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(1)(iii). confidence that a registrant’s GHG emissions disclosure is reliable as compared to limited assurance,1231 we have de termined that it is appropriate to apply the reasonable assurance requirement to a more limited pool of registrants – LAFs – at this time because some LAFs are already collecting and disclosing climate -related information, including GHG emissions data,1232 and larger issuers generally bear proportionately lower compliance costs than smaller issuers due to the fixed cost components of such compliance. This scaled approach will avoid increasing compliance burdens for AFs that may be smaller or less sophisticated issuers. We considered whether to require LAFs to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level from the start as suggested by some commenters. 1233 However, most registrants that are voluntarily obtaining assurance today obtain limited assura nce rather than reasonable assurance,1234 and therefore a transition period is appropriate to give LAFs and GHG emissions attestation providers time to prepare for the higher level of assurance. In contrast to some commenters’ suggestion that obtaining reas onable assurance would be impractical, 1235 we note that some registrants have voluntarily obtained reasonable assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure. 1236 In addition, one commenter stated that it agreed with the Commission’s statement 1231 See, e.g. , letter from GRI. 1232 According to one study, 99% of S&P 500 companies reported ESG information in 2021 and 65% of such companies reported obtaining assurance over some ESG information. See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500-and-esg-reporting . In addition, according to the study, over 63% of S&P 500 companies reported obtaining assurance specifically over some portion of their GHG emissions disclosures . See id. Based on an analysis by Commission staff on Feb. 29, 202 4, a substantial number of the S&P 500 companies (494) are LAFs . 1233 See supra note 1145 and accompanying text. 1234 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500- and-esg-reporting (stating that in 2021 most companies that obtained assurance from public company auditors and other providers opted for limited assurance). 1235 See, e.g. , letter from INGAA. 1236 See supra note 1217. in the Proposing Release that limited assurance is not possible unless the assurance provider also believes reasonable assurance is possible on the subject matter.1237 We recognize that obtaining reasonable assurance over GHG emissions disclosure will be more costly than obtaining limited assurance because the scope of work in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than the scope of work in a reasonable assurance engagement. The primary difference between the two levels of assurance relates to the nature, tim ing, and extent of procedures required to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to support the limited assurance conclusion or reasonable assurance opinion. For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). Therefore, we agree with those commenters that stated reasonable 1237 See letter from ERM CVS. As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance engagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the engagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. Thus, if the subject matter i s appropriate for a limited assurance engagement, it is also appropriate for a reasonable assurance engagement. See Proposing Release, section II.H.1 See also, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18 , Attestation Standards, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/ aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae- no- 18.pdf ; and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information , available at https://www.ifac.org/_flysystem/azure - private/publications/files/ISAE%203000%20Revised%20- %20for%20IAASB.pdf . 1238 See, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 105.A14. 1239 See, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 205.18. assurance will provide greater value to investors because at the reasonable assurance level, investors receive more reliable information about GHG emissions.1240 Registrants may also benefit from providing disclosures subject to a rea sonable assurance level because such assurance enhances investor confidence in the disclosures, and as a result, may lower the cost of capital for registrants. 1241 As explained above, LAFs are best positioned to bear the increased costs of obtaining reasonable assurance. Such costs are justified for these registrants by the benefits that investors and registrants will receive in the form of positive assurance, which makes it more likely that material errors or omissions are detected and is consistent with the Commission’s investor protection mission. In light of the significant phased in compliance period that LAFs will have before reasonable assurance is required, we expect that registrants will incur these costs over several years, which should make the burden easier to bear in any particular year. We also expect that during the significant phased in compliance period new assurance providers will enter the market and any resulting increase in competition will lead to relative reductions in the costs of providing those services over time. 1242 We considered whether it would be appropriate to wait to make a determination about whether LAFs should be required to scale up to reasonable assurance, but decided against such 1240 See supra note 1145 and accompanying text. 1241 See letter from Anthesis Grp. See also supra note 1207. 1242 See letter from Futurepast ( expressing the view that the existence of a larger pool of potential GHG emissions attestation providers will enhance competition and likely result in lower costs to registrants). In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in Sections II.I.2.c and 3.c., we expect that registrants’ ability to hire a non- accounting firm as a GHG emissions attestation provider and our decision to make certain modifications to the proposed requirements applicable to the GHG emissions attestation engagement should help address concerns about the supply of GHG emissions attestation providers. an approach because the benefits of obtaining reasonable assurance are apparen t now1243 and we do not expect those to change in the future, while our decision to limit the reasonable assurance requirement to a narrower scope of registrants and to provide a significant transition period will help address the concerns raised by commente rs. We also considered the suggestion by one commenter that the Commission initially require registrants to obtain reasonable assurance, followed by limited assurance engagements to the extent the first year’s attestation report included no qualifications ; however, for the reasons stated above, the scaled approach, starting with limited assurance and subsequently moving to reasonable assurance , will allow LAFs time for their processes and controls to mature before being subject to the higher level of assur ance. It will also provide attestation service providers that do not currently provide assurance over GHG emissions disclosure with additional time to familiarize themselves with providing assurance over such disclosure, which, as noted above, should faci litate additional competition between assurance providers and further help decrease costs of compliance. A number of commenters recommended that the Commission extend the phase in periods in the final rules because the proposed compliance schedule would have been too challenging for registrants to meet. 1244 We agree with commenters that extending the phase in periods would provide registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers with additional time to prepare for implementation of the rules and would allow assurance standards and practices applicable to 1243 See supra note 1193; Brandon Gipper, et al. , Carbon Accounting Quality: Measurement and the Role of Assurance (Nov . 2023) , available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=4627783 (concluding that reasonable assurance improves carbon accounting quality more than limited assurance). See also letters from GRI (“Reasonable assurance should be adopted as this would be commensurate with the level of assurance provided through statutory audits of financial statements and will give information users increased confidence that t he reported information is prepared in accordance with stated criteria.”); and PWYP (“Given the importance of GHG emissions data to enable investors to fully understand the climate -related risks of issuers, reasonable assurance is necessary to ensure that information is subjected to sufficient examination and verification such that it can be relied on by investors.”). 1244 See supra note 1166 and accompanying text. GHG emissions to further evolve while balancing investors’ need for the information. Therefore, as compared to the proposal, the final rules provide AFs and LAFs with additional time before they are required to comply with the GHG emissions assurance requirements in addition to the phased in GHG emissions compliance dates. 1245 Providing two phased in compliance dates —one before registrants are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirem ents and another before registrants are required to comply with the assurance requirements —will allow registrants and assurance providers to gain experience with the new rules before assurance is required. Commenters expressed a variety of views about whether the Commission should define the terms “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” in the final rules. Some commenters stated that definitions or guidance could be helpful or reduce any potential confusion, 1246 while other commenters stated that no definition is needed.1247 We have determined not to include definitions of “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” in the final rules because we agree with the commenters that stated that this terminology is generally well understood1248 and should be defined by assurance standard setters and not by the Commission.1249 As we explained in the Proposing Release, “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” are currently defined by the prevailing attestation standards.1250 Furthermore, we expect the descr iption of the work performed as a basis for the assurance provider’s conclusion on the GHG emissions attestation 1245 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a). See also infra section II.O.3 for further discussion of the compliance dates for the final rules. 1246 See supra note 1180 and accompanying text. 1247 See supra note 1183 and accompanying text. 1248 See letter from CFA Institute. 1249 See letter from Mazars. 1250 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. See also, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 105.10 and IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) § 12(a)(i). engagement to be included in any assurance report issued pursuant to the final rules, which should facilitate investors’ understanding of the nature of the limited or reasonable assurance engagement. 1251 One commenter asked the Commission to clarify how the terms “limited assurance” and “reasonable assurance” relate to the “standard GHG terms of ‘measured,’ ‘monitored,’ and ‘verified.’”1252 It is our general understanding that “measured,” “monitored,” and “verified” are terms commonly used in the marketplace to describe the process for calculating and reporting GHG emissions data. 1253 Although such a process could share some s imilarities with the steps GHG emission attestation providers undertake during the course of an assurance engagement, such a process is distinct from the assurance required by the final rules, which must be performed in accordance with a standard that meet s the requirements detailed below. Another commenter urged the Commission to provide a definition of limited assurance that establishes “a process more rigorous than currently used for assurance of quarterly SEC filings.” 1254 However, doing so would potent ially result in the Commission’s definition of limited assurance being different from, or conflicting with, the definitions included in the prevailing attestation standards that we expect many GHG emissions attestation providers will use, which could cause confusion. 1251 See, e.g. , IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) § 69(k) . 1252 See letter from IECA. 1253 For example, the draft interagency report entitled, “Federal Strategy to Advance Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors (Strategy),” states that “Measurement, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MMRV) refers to ac tivities undertaken to quantify GHG emissions and sinks (through direct measurement and/or modeling), monitor emission over time, verify estimates, and synthesize and report on findings.” See Federal Strategy to Advance Measurement and Monitoring Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors , 88 FR 44251 (July 12, 2023). 1254 See supra note 1180. As discussed above, the final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates , or may be included in an amended annual report on Form 10- K no later than the due date for such Form 10- Q.1255 The extension of the deadline for the filing of GHG emissions metrics also applies to the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emissions disclosure to which the report applies.1256 This additional time —an additional two fiscal q uarters —should provide registrants subject to Item 1505 and their GHG emissions attestation providers with sufficient time to measure GHG emissions, provide assurance, and prepare the required attestation report. Consistent with the notice requirements in cluded in Item 1505(c), the final rules (Item 1506(f)) provide that a registrant that elects to incorporate by reference its attestation report from its Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter or to provide its attestation report in an amended annual repor t must include an express statement in its annual report indicating its intention to either incorporate by reference the attestation report from a quarterly report on F orm 10 -Q or amend its annual report to provide the attestation report by the due date specified in Item 1505.1257 1255 See 17 CFR 220. 1505(c)(1). If the registrant is a foreign private issuer, the final rules provide that its GHG emissions disclosure may be included in an amendment to its annual report on Form 20- F, which shall be due no later than 225 days after the end of the fiscal y ear to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates. See id. See also supra s ection II.H.3. 1256 See 17 CFR 229.1506( f). 1257 See id. The proposed rules would have required the attestation report to be included in the separately captioned “Climate- Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing.1258 However, as discussed above, the final rules leave the placement of climate -related disclosures, other than the financial statement disclosures, largely up to each registrant.1259 As such, a registrant will not be required to include the attestation report in a separately captioned “Climate -Related Disclosure” section, although it may elect to do so.1260 Consistent with the proposed rules, during the phased in compliance period when limited assurance is required for LAFs, the final rules (Item 1506( a)(1)(ii)) permit a n LAF, at its option, to obtain re asonable assurance of its Scope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure.1261 Similarly, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(i)) permit an AF, at its option, to obtain reasonable assurance of its Scope 1 and/or 2 emissions disclosure . In addition, at its option, a registrant that is subject to the assurance requirements would be able to obtain any level of assurance over its GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a).1262 For filings made after the compliance date for the GHG emissions disclosure requirements but before Item 1506(a) requires limited assurance, a registrant would only be required to provide the disclosure called for by Item 1506(e).1263 For filings made after the compliance date for assurance required by Item 1506(a) , to avoid potential confusion, the additional, voluntary assurance obtained by 1258 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1259 See supra s ection II.A.3. 1260 See id. for further discussion of presentation requirements for GHG emissions disclosure under the final rules. 1261 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1262 Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosures are required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a). As noted above, no registrants are required to provide Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosures; however, a registrant may choose to provide such disclosure voluntarily. 1263 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(3). such filer would be required to follow the requirements of Item s 1506(b) through (d), including using the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions , which was supported by one commenter.1264 Although in the Proposing Release, the requirements outlined in this paragraph would have applied to any climate -related disclosures not subject to assurance under Item 1506(a),1265 we have narrowed the scope of the final rule to apply only to GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured under Item 1506(a) because, given the modifications in t he final rule, we think it is unlikely that registrants will voluntarily obtain assurance over non -GHG emissions disclosure for which the disclosure required by 1506(e) would be useful to investors . 1266 Therefore, to reduce the complexity of the final rules , we are streamlining it in this way. In addition, as discussed below in s ection II.I.5, a registrant that is not subject to Item 1505 but that voluntarily discloses GHG emissions information and voluntarily obtains assurance w ill be required to comply only with Item 1506(e), if applicable. For ease of reference, we have included a table reflecting the application of these requirements: 1264 See letter from Amer . for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al.; 17 CFR 229.1506(a)( 3). For example, if a n LAF was required to obtain reasonable assurance over its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure and the attestation provider chose to follow, for example, the AICPA attestation standards, the LAF could voluntarily obtain limited assurance over any voluntary Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosure , and the attestation provider would be required to follow the AICPA’s attestation standard for providing limited assurance. 1265 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.1. 1266 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(3). 2. GHG Emissions Attestation Provider Requirements a. Proposed Rules The proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHG emissions After the Compliance Date for GHG Emissions Disclosure but before the Compliance Date for Assurance After the Compliance Date for Assurance LAFs and AFs subject to Item s 1505 and 1506(a) through (d) (e.g., registrants that are required to disclose GHG emissions and obtain assurance) Any voluntary assurance over any GHG emissions disclosure must comply with the disclosure requirements in Item 1506(e). Any voluntary assurance obtained over GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured pursuant to Item 1506(a) (e.g., voluntary Scope 3 disclosures) must follow the requirements of Item 1506( b) through (d), including using the same attestation standard as the registrant’s required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 disclosure. Registrants not subject to Item s 1505 or 1506(a) through (d) (e.g., registrants that are not required to disclose GHG emissions) Any voluntary assurance over any GHG emissions disclosure must comply with the disclosure requirements in Item 1506(e) Any voluntary assurance over any GHG emissions disclosure must comply with the discl osure requirements in Item 1506(e). of the Securities Act.1346 One of these commenters further stated that “[f]or any period for which assurance is not required for GHG emissions attestation reports, the SEC should clarify that the reports will still be considered to be expertized material, to avoid inadvertently subjecting underwriters to heightened due diligence requirements during an interim period of disclosure implementation.” 1347 c. Final Rules (Item 1506(b)) We are adopting the GHG emissions attestation provider requirements substantially as proposed.1348 We continue to believe that the expertise requirements (Item 1506(b)(1)) are necessary to help ensure that the service provider preparing the attestation report has sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute the attestation engagement. 1349 Several commenters agreed with the proposal’s expertise requirements and definition of significant experience.1350 While some commenters urged the Commission to require a GHG emissions attestation provider to have a certain number of years of experience,1351 other commenters stated that the Commission should not prescribe a minimum number of years.1352 We do not think it is necessary to require a provider to have a certain number of years of experience because imposing such a requirement could result in a “ch eck the box” mentality, and we believe that investors 1346 See, e.g. , letters from BPI; and Financial Services Forum. 1347 See letter from BPI. 1348 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b). To enhance clarity, we are making one minor change to the rule text. In the definition of “significant experience” in the final rules, we are substituting the proposed rule’s reference to “professional standards” with a reference to “attestation standards” to make it clear that the standards being referenced in Item 1506(b)(1)(i) are the attestation standards that meet the r equirements of Item 1506(a). See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(1)(i). 1349 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.2. 1350 See supra notes 1287 and 1297 and accompanying text. 1351 See supra note 1298 and accompanying text. 1352 See supra note 1299 and accompanying text. would be better served by registrants undertaking a more holistic consideration of a provider’s qualifications in selecting a provider. Some commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance regarding the qualifications for a GHG emissions attestation provider; 1353 however, these commenters generally did not identify any particular aspects of the expertise requirement that required clarification. Adopting a principles -based approach inherently involves some uncertainty, but we believe registrants would be better served by such flexibility than an approach that, for example, identifies a static list of qualified providers . Such an approach will provide a registrant with more leeway to s elect a GHG emissions attestation provider that has the experience that best fits the registrant’s facts and circumstances, which could improve the quality of assurance provided thereby enhancing the reliability of GHG emissions disclosures. In response to a question included in the Proposing Release, some commenters stated that the Commission should specify that a GHG emissions attestation provider meets the expertise requirements if it is a member in good standing of a specified accreditation body and i dentified particular bodies or approaches the Commission should consider. 1354 We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. Several commenters recommended that the Commission specify additional qualifications for GHG emissions attestation providers, 1355 and while we considered each of these suggestions, we 1353 See supra notes 1300 and 1301 and accompanying text. 1354 See supra notes 1305 , 1307, and 1308 and accompanying text . 1355 See supra note 1312 and accompanying text. believe that the requirements we have included in the final rules will help ensure that GHG emissions attestation providers have sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute the attestatio n engagement. While a number of commenters urged the Commission to require that a GHG emissions attestation provider be a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB, 1356 we determined to retain the principles -based approach in the final rules because it will provide registrants with the flexibility to hire a non -accounting firm that may have relevant or specialized experience with respect to assuring GHG emissions disclosure while at the same time ensuring that a GHG emissions attestation provider has the requisite expertise to perform the engagement in accordance with professional standards. Although we agree there would be investor protection benefits to be gained by requiring a registrant to use a PCAOB -regulated entity that is subject to oversight and inspections (even though the PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction would not include engagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosure within its scope),1357 we have balanced this against other considerations, such as the availability of GHG emissions providers and compliance costs, which could potentially be lower if a larger pool of assurance providers is available. Nevertheless, we agree with those commenters who stated that if the final rules permit non-PCAOB -registered accounting firms to provide attestation services, the Commission would need to ensure that there are appropriate protections in place for investors. 1358 The expertise, 1356 See supra note 1294 and accompanying text. 1357 The PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of issuers, brokers, and dealers and would not include engagements for the assurance of GHG emissions disclosure within its scope. See 15 U.S.C. 7214 (setting forth the PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction). However, as discussed in greater detail below, oversight inspection programs can provide benefits, such as providing a check on a GHG emissions attestation provider’s overall activities and driving improvements in the quality of services overall, even when an oversight inspection program does not include a GHG emissions attestation engagement within its scope . 1358 See supra note 1292 and accompanying text. independence, and other requirements applicable to the GHG emissions attestation engagement under the final rules, s uch as the requirement for a provider to use attestation standards that are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, are intended to serve precisely that function. As with the proposed rules, the final rules apply the expe rtise requirement to the person or firm signing the GHG emissions attestation report. 1359 If the service provider is a firm, we would expect it to have policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that the personnel selected to c onduct the GHG emissions attestation engagement have significant experience with respect to both attestation engagements and GHG emissions. As we explained in the Proposing Release, this would mean that the service provider has the qualifications necessar y for fulfillment of the responsibilities that it would be called on to assume, including the appropriate engagement of specialists, if needed. 1360 A few commenters supported a requirement for GHG emissions attestation providers to establish policies and procedures along these lines. 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). As noted above, one commenter recommended that the Commission consider whether state licensure laws would preclude parties other than CPAs from performing attestation 1359 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b). 1360 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.2. 1361 See supra note 1315 and accompanying text. services.1362 It is our understanding that states typically require someone who holds its elf out as a public accountant or as performing public accounting services to be licensed as a CPA. In addition, non- CPAs are not able to use the AICPA or PCAOB attestation standards.1363 However, these principles would not prevent a non- CPA from performin g attestation services as long as it was neither holding itself out as a CPA nor using an attestation standard that, by its terms, is only available to CPAs. In this regard, we note that the IAASB and ISO standards, two of the four standards we are explic itly permitting assurance providers to use under the final rules (as discussed in more detail below), are not restricted to CPAs , and we are not aware that any state laws are currently impacting the ability of non -CPA service providers to provide assurance over GHG emissions. With respect to independence, we are adopting each of the independence requirements (Item 1506(b) (2)) as proposed. 1364 These independence requirement s are important because they help ensure that the attestation provider will perform the engagement in an objective and impartial manner. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirement for a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with respect to the registrant and any of its affiliates and agreed that the independe nce requirement would enhance the reliability of the 1362 See letter from PwC. See also letter from NASBA (“Virtually all of the State Boards do not allow non - CPAs to perform attestation services or issue reports u nder the professional standards governing the public accounting profession.”). 1363 By their terms, AICPA and PCAOB attestation standards are only applicable in the context of engagements performed by certified public accountants. See, e.g. , PCAOB AT s ection 101, Attest Engagements, available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/attestation -standards/details/AT101 (stating that “[t]his section applies to engagements . . . in which a certified public accountant in the practice of public accounting . . . is engaged to issue or does issue an examination, a review, or an agreed- upon procedures report on subject matter . . .”) (emphasis added); AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 105.01 (“This section applies to engagements in which a CPA in the practice of public a ccounting is engaged to issue, or does issue, a practitioner’s examination, review, or agreed -upon procedures report on subject matter or an assertion about subject matter (hereinafter referred to as an assertion) that is the responsibility of another party.”) (emphasis added) . 1364 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2). attestation report.1365 We continue to believe that, similar to how assurance provided by independent public accountants improves the reliability of financial statements and disclosures and is a critical component of our capital markets, assurance of GHG emissions disclosure by independent service providers should also improve the reliability of such disclosure. 1366 Several commenters agreed with the Commission’s proposed approach of modeling the independen ce requirement and relevant definitions on the Commission’s qualifications for accountants under Rule 2 -01 of Regulation S -X, 1367 and we continue to believe the approach is appropriate given our experience in administering Rule 2- 01 in the context of financi al statement audits. One commenter appeared to suggest that, under the proposed rules, GHG emissions attestation providers would not be subject to the same level of independence as financial statement auditors. 1368 Although the final rules do not set forth a non- exclusive specification of circumstances inconsistent with independence like Rule 2- 01(c) does for financial statement auditors, the foundational principles underlying the independence requirements in Rule 2- 01 and the final rules are the same ,1369 and we view the independence requirements in the two contexts as providing similar, if not equivalent, protections to investors. However, for the avoidance of any doubt, we are clarifying that registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers are only 1365 See supra note 1317 and accompanying text. 1366 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.2. 1367 See supra notes 1321 and 1324 and accompanying text. 1368 See letter from PwC. 1369 Namely, the final rules provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all iss ues encompassed within the attestation provider’s engagement, which is modeled on Rule 2- 01(b). Compare 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(i) and 17 CFR 210.2- 01(b). Also, the final rules model the factors the Commission will consider in determining whether a GHG emi ssions attestation provider is independent on the introductory text to Rule 2 -01. Compare 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii) and Introductory Text to Rule 2- 01. required to comply with the independence requirements included in Item 1506 and are not required to separately comply with the independence requirements included in Rule 2- 01 with respect to the GHG emissions attestation engagement.1370 Along those lines, existing Commission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2- 01 do not apply to the independence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or interpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly p resented under Item 1506 (which is a possibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2- 01), the guidance or interpretation would be a useful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371 We considered the concern raised by commenters tha t requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially increase costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are mitigated by the modifications in the final rules that provide registrant s subject to the requirements with a multi- year transition period before they are required to obtain an attestation report. The phased in compliance period will give registrants adequate time to find a provider that meets the independence requirements. I t will also give non- accountant attestation providers time to familiarize themselves with the independence requirements and adapt their business practices accordingly, which may help mitigate any adverse effects that the independence requirements could hav e on the available pool of providers. For this reason, we do not think it is necessary, as suggested by some commenters, 1370 The final rules do not alter or amend Rule 2- 01 or its current applicability in any way, which me ans, for example, there is no change to the requirement that registrants and their financial statement auditor comply with Rule 2 -01 with respect to the financial statement audit. 1371 The staff of the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants or GHG emissions attestation providers regarding the independence requirements in the final rules. 1372 See supra notes 1327 , 1328, and 1331 and accompanying text. to adopt an alternative to the independence requirement to simply disclose the fees received.1373 Although requiring the disclosure of any fees , including non- attestation fe es, received by the GHG emissions attestation provider from the registrant would provide investors with important information for evaluat ing the objectivity of the attestation provider , such an alternative would not prohibit the GHG emissions attestation provider from performing the GHG emissions assurance services in circumstances where the provider was not independent from the registrant (as the final rules will do) . A few commenters stated that the proposed rules’ references to accounting or audit -style requirements could favor accounting firms, 1374 and we acknowledge that some of the requirements in the final rule s, such as the independence requirements, may be more familiar to accounting firms versus non- accounting firms. However, we believe the principles -based approach in the final rules generally should be accessible for both accounting and non- accounting firms. Moreover , the phased in compliance period should give non- accountant attestation providers time to f amiliarize themselves with the independence requirements and provide existing service providers with time to unwind any existing conflicts to their independence. Some commenters suggested that the proposed independence requirement was problematic because i t would seem to prohibit an expert or other third- party that has assisted a registrant in calculating or preparing its GHG emissions data from serving as the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider. 1375 We agree that it would be difficult for an exp ert that has assisted a registrant in calculating or preparing its GHG emissions data to meet the independence 1373 See supra note 1335 and accompanying text. 1374 See supra note 1293 and accompanying text. 1375 See supra note 1329 and accompanying text. requirements because such an engagement would presumably place the attestation provider in the position of attesting to its own work and may crea te a mutual interest between the attestation provider and the registrant, two of the factors the final rules state the Commission will consider in determining whether the GHG emissions provider is independent.1376 We think the conflict of interest presented by this circumstance is exactly the type of situation that the independence requirement is intended to prevent , and therefore we are not modifying the independence requirement in response to these commenters’ concerns. As a result, this could mean that a registrant that determines it is necessary to hire a third -party service provider to help it calculate or prepare its GHG emissions disclosure may have to pay a fee to both the third- party service provider and to its GHG emissions attestation provider. H owever, the likelihood of this scenario is reduced by the multiyear phase in compliance period we are adopting, which provides registrants with sufficient time to develop the necessary processes and procedures to calculate their GHG emissions data before t hey are required to comply with the assurance requirements. In addition, the exemption from the GHG emissions reporting and assurance requirements for SRCs and EGCs provides most new ly public companies with time to develop any in- house expertise that may be necessary in case they no longer qualify for SRC or EGC status in the future and become subject to the final rules. In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant’s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). Conversely, we generally expect that a registrant would be able to use its financial statement auditor as its GHG emissions atte station provider consistent with the independence requirement in the final rules . 1377 See supra note 1332 and accompanying text. note that the Commission’s determination in each of its rulemakings about whether to require a registrant to reta in an independent third- party is context specific. For example, with respect to its mining disclosure rules, the Commission stated that it was not adopting a requirement for a qualified person to be independent from the registrant because, among other thi ngs, the final rules require a registrant to disclose the qualified person’s affiliated status with the registrant or another entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, which is consistent with the Committee for Mineral Reserve s International Reporting Standards’ mining guidelines, to which the Commission was amending its mining rules to more closely align. 1378 With respect to its oil and gas disclosure rules, the Commission pointed out that most commenters did not support a requirement to obtain an independent third- party assessment of reserves estimates because a company’s internal staff is generally in a bet ter position to prepare those estimates and there is a potential lack of qualified third party engineers and professionals available. 1379 However, the Commission did adopt a requirement for a registrant to provide a general discussion of the internal controls it uses to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the disclosure of the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the reserves estimates. 1380 In keeping with this context specific approach, with respect to assurance over GHG emissions disclosure, we believe that the benefits to investors from requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent in accordance with Item 1506 justify the potential costs for the reasons stated above. Moreover, there is currently a growing 1378 See Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants , Release No. 33 -10098 (June 16, 2016) [81 FR 41651, 41661 (June 27, 2016)]; Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants , Release No. 33 -10570 (Oct. 31, 2018) [83 FR 66344 , 66363 (Dec. 26, 2018)]. 1379 See Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Release No. 8995 (Dec. 31, 2008) [74 FR 2157, 2175 (Jan. 14, 2009) ]. 1380 See id. practice among some registrants of obtaining third -party assurance over their GHG emissions data.1381 Although generally the independence requirements in the assurance standards currently being used with respect to GHG emissions data are not as robust as the requirements in the final rules, many of these standards include requirements related to the objectivity and impartiality of the third -party assurance provider .1382 Therefore, the final rules’ independence requirement is not inconsistent with the general practice in this space of retaining an objective and impartial third -party to provide assurance .1383 In addition, we are adopting the definition of “affiliate” as p roposed and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters that addressed this issue.1384 Similarly, we are adopting the broad definition of “a ttestation and professional engagement period” as proposed, which is modeled on the definition of “audit and professional engagement period” in Rule 2 -01.1385 As discussed in greater detail above, in response to a request for comment, some commenters recommended that the Commission require the GHG emissions attestation provider 1381 See supra note 1232. 1382 See, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C § 105.2 6; IAASB ISAE 3000 (Revised) § 20; and ISO 14064 -3: 2019 § 4.2. The independence requirements in the final rules ar e more rigorous and may diffe r in scope from the requirements included in these standards. It is possible that the application of the independence requirements in the final rule s may result in a GHG emissions attestation provider no longer being able to provide certain non- assurance services to its assurance client that may be permissible to provide outside the context of the final rules . 1383 The International Ethics Standards Board for Accoun tants (IESBA), which is an independent global ethics standard -setting board, has recently proposed ethics standards for sustainability assurance providers (i.e., professional accountants and other professionals performing sustainability assurance engagements) , including robust independence standards. IESBA stated that it “holds to the premise that sustainability assurance engagements . . . must be underpinned by the same high standards of ethical behavior and independence that apply to audits of financial information.” See IESBA, Explanatory Memorandum for Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (including International Independence Standards) ( IESSA ) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting , available at https://ifacweb.blob.core.windows.net/publicfiles/2024- 01/Proposed%20IESSA%20and%20Other%20Revisions%20to%20the%20Code%20Relating%20to%20Su stainability%20Assurance%20and%20Reporting%20- %20Explanatory%20Memorandum.pdf . 1384 See supra note 1324. 1385 See letter from RSM . to be subject to additional minimum q uality control requirements.1386 We have determined not to impose such requirements at this time; however, we reiterate the statement the Commission made in the Proposing Release that accountants are already required to comply with relevant quality control and management standards when providing audit and attest services under PCAOB, AICPA, or IAASB standards, and those quality control and management standards would similarly apply to accountants providing GHG emissions attestation services pursuant to these standards. 1387 The IAASB standards impose similar quality control requirements on non- accountants .1388 In addition, one commenter stated that, for example, all firms that are accredited by one of the members of the IAF must have a quality control and management system.1389 As such, we believe that many of the more experienced non- accountant GHG emissions at testation providers are required to comply with quality control requirements. More generally, we expect that any attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules would likely provide guidance on quality control for assurance providers. 1390 1386 See supra note 1340 and accompanying text. 1387 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.2. 1388 See IAASB ISAE 3000.3(b) (Revised) (“The practitioner who is performing the engagement is a member of a firm that is su bject to [International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1], or other professional requirements, or requirements in law or regulation, regarding the firm’s responsibility for its system of quality control, that are at least as demanding as ISQC 1.”). 1389 See letter from ERM CVS. The International Accreditation Forum is a worldwide association of accreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment in the fields of management systems, products, processes, services, personnel, validat ion and verification and other similar programs of conformity assessment. See International Accreditation Forum, About IAF, available at https://iaf.nu/en/about/. Its members include ANAB, the ANSI National Accreditation Board, which provides accreditation to greenhouse gas verification and validation providers that demonstrate competence to validate or verify statements in accordance with its accreditation requi rements, including ISO 14065. 1390 The ISO standards, which are used by many non- accountant GHG emissions attestation providers as described in greater detail below, include two standards that can be used as a basis for requirements for attestation provide rs related to impartiality, competency, and communication, which are areas typically covered by quality control requirements. See ISO 14065, General principles and requirements for bodies validating and verifying environmental information (2020); and ISO 14066, Environmental information – Competence requirements for teams validating and verifying environmental information (2023). Although the final rules do not include a requirement that a registrant’s audit committee pre-approve the GHG emissions attestation services, nor was such a requirement proposed, it would be permissible under the final rules for a registrant to use the auditor of its financial statements to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagement, assuming the final rules’ requirements for assurance providers are met. To the extent that the registrant’s auditor is engaged to provide an attestation report in connection with the registrant’s GHG emissions, or with respect to any other climate -related disclosures, the auditor would be required to comply with applicable, existing pre -approval requirements. 1391 Even in circumstances where the GHG emissions attestatio n services are not subject to a pre- approval requirement, however, audit committees should consider what level of involvement would be appropriate for them to take with respect to the selection and retention of attestation providers for climate -related dis closures. In addition, in response to commenters’ feedback, 1392 we are amending Rule 436 to provide that a report by a n attestation provider covering Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statement s made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. 1393 We determined to include this amendment, in part, because we agree with commenters that the potential for s ection 11 liability could deter or reduce the number of a ttestation provider s willing to accept these 1391 See 15 U.S.C. 78j -1(i). See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant’s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered “Audit -Related Fees” for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 16C of Form 20 -F, or any similar requirements). 1392 See supra note 1344 and accompanying text. 1393 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1). engagements.1394 However, we are limiting the exception to those GHG emissions attestation engagements performed at a limited assurance level to encourage GHG emissions attestation providers to perform such engagements. We think t here could be reluctance on the part of a GHG emissions attestation provider to perform attestation engagements at the limited assurance level because of their potential liability under s ection 11, and that, alternatively, if GHG emissions attestation prov iders perform significantly expanded procedures, much closer to reasonable assurance, in order to meet potential liability concerns under s ection 11, substantial increased costs to issuers could result. 1395 The same considerations do not apply to reasonable assurance engagements , and we are therefore not providing a similar exception for those engagements . The amendment to Rule 436 also states that a report covering Scope 3 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority t o the statements made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. 1396 Although no registrants are required to disclose Scope 3 emissions or obtain an attestation report for Scope 3 emissions under the final rules, we have included Scope 3 emissions within the exception contained in Rule 436 in the event that a registrant voluntarily discloses its Scope 3 emissions. We believe it is appropriate to provide these accommodations to encourage registrants to obtain limited assurance over Scope 3 disclosure . 1394 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text. 1395 The Commission relied upon a similar rationale when it amended Rule 436 to provide that a report prepared or certified by an accountant within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act shall not include a report by an independent accountant on a review of unaudited interim financial statements. See Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information Under Securities Act of 1933, Release No. 33 -6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601, 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980)]. 1396 See 17 CFR 230.436(i)(1). Although not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their incentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would result in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential downsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted above,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment of an accountant’s report on unaudited interim financial statements included in a registration statement, which is also provided at the limited assurance level . Therefore, in these particular circumstances, we believe it is appropriate to provide these accommodations. One result of the amendments to Rule 436 is that a GHG emis sions attestation provider that has performed an attestation engagement over GHG emissions at a limited assurance level is not required to submit a consent in connection with the registration statement under s ection 7 of the Securities Act. 1399 However, we think it is nonetheless important that a GHG emissions attestation provider have some awareness about whether its attestation report is included in a 1397 In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level . This could reduce the incentives for GHG emissions attestation providers to perform a thorough analysis and ensure that their attestation report, which is required to be included in a registration statement with GHG emissions disclosures to which the assurance services relate, i s true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading . We remind registrants and providers , however, that there are other remedies available to shareholders and /or the Commission, such as s ection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b- 5 thereunder and section 17(a) of the Securities Act , which are not affected by the amendments to Rule 436. 1398 See supra note 1395. 1399 See 15 U.S.C. 77g. The amendments to Rule 436 provide that a report by a GHG emissions attestation provider covering Scope 1, Scope 2 , and/or Scope 3 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered part of the registration statement prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statements made, and therefore the requirement in s ection 7 of the Securities Act that written consent is required from “any person whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him” that is “named as having prepared or certifi ed a report . . . for use in connection with the registration statement” does not apply. registration statement under the Securities Act .1400 Therefore, we are also amending Item 601 of Regulation S -K, which details the exhibits required to be included in Securities Act and Exchange Act filings , to require registrants to file as an exhibit to certain registration statements under the Securitie s Act or report s on Form 10- K or 10- Q that are incorporated into the se registration statements a letter from the attestation provider that acknowledges its awareness of the use in certain registration statements of any of its reports which are not subject to the consent requirement of s ection 7.1401 We are amending the Instructions as to Exhibits section of Form 20-F to include the same requirement for Form 20- F filers to the extent the Form 20 -F is incorporated into a registration statement under the Securi ties Act.1402 We note that certain commenters urged the Commission to confirm that any attestation reports are expertized material, stating that otherwise underwriters may face heighte ned due diligence requirements in light of potential s ection 11 liabil ity over GHG emission disclosures 1400 The Commission relied on this same rationale when it adopt ed an amendment requir ing issuers to file as an exhibit to a registration statement a letter from the independent accountants that acknowledges its awareness of the use in a registration statement of any of its reports which are not subject to the consent requirement of s ection 7. See Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information Under Securities Act of 1933, Release No. 33 -6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601 , 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980)] ; Amendments Regarding Exhibit Requirements , Release No. 6230 (Sept. 5, 1980) [45 FR 58822, 58824 (Sept. 5 , 1980)] . 1401 See 17 CFR 229.601(b)( 27). This requirement is modeled on the requirement for an issuer to file as an exhibit to a registration statement a letter from the independent public accountant, which acknowledges their awareness that their report on unaudited interim financial information is being included in a registration statement. See 17 CFR 229.601(b)(15); Accountant Liability for Reports on Unaudited Interim Financial Information Under Securities Act of 1933, Re lease No. 33 -6173 (Jan. 8, 1980) [45 FR 1601 , 1604 (Jan. 8, 1980) ]; Amendments Regarding Exhibit Requirements , Release No. 6230 (Sept. 5, 1980) [45 FR 58822, 58824 (Sept. 5, 1980)] . Although the Commission did not solicit comment specifically on the requirement to provide an acknowledgement letter, the requirement follows from similar contexts noted above. In addition, the associated burdens on issuers are less than the proposed c onsent requirement while retaining the benefit of providing notice to the assurance provider. Further, to help facilitate registrants’ compliance with the requirement to file the letter from the GHG emissions attestation provider as an exhibit, we have included an instruction to Item 1506 that directs registrants obtaining assurance at a limited assurance level to Item 601(b)(27) ( as well as to paragraph 18 of Form 20- F’s Instructions as to Exhibits , as discussed infra note 1402 and accompanying text ). 1402 See Instructions as to Exhibits 18 of Form 20- F. Where Form 20 -F is used a registration statement under the Exchange Act, this exhibit would not be required. included in a registration statement.1403 We also note, as discussed above, that certain commenters stated that deeming the information expertized may have the effect of deterring or reducing available assurance providers.1404 We believe the approach we have taken appropriately addresses these co ncerns by exempting the GHG emissions attestation providers that perform limited assurance engagements from section 11 liability and the consent requirements associated with expertized reports, and requiring consent with corresponding section 11 liability only when the heightened level of review associated with reasonable assurance makes it appropriate for the report to be expertized. This bifurcated approach to reasonable versus limited assurance engagements is consistent with the current treatment of audited financial statements and unaudited (reviewed) interim financial statements.1405 While we recognize underwriters and other non- issuer defendants subject to potential liability under section 11 may face additional due diligence costs during the transition period or where limited assurance is required,1406 we do not believe this is unduly burdensome compared to other climate -related information that will be required in a registration statement pursuant to the final rules that is not otherwise expertized. Moreover, absent a mandatory limited assurance requirement in the final rules, a registrant would nonetheless be required to disclose its GHG emissions and underwriters and other defendants subject to potential liability under s ection 11 would be faced with the same potential liability and due diligence costs with respect to those 1403 See supra note 1346 and accompanying text. 1404 See supra note 1345 and accompanying text. 1405 See infra s ection II.I.5.c discussing an additional amendment to Rule 436 in the context of a registrant’s statements pertaining to voluntary assurance received over GHG emissions disclosure. 1406 Compare 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(C) (providing underwriters and others with a defense for expertized material) with 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(A) (providing underwriters and others with a defense for non- expertized materials) . disclosures .1407 Finally, the other defenses to liability included in Securities Act s ection 11(b) remain available in accordance with the terms of that provision.1408 3. GHG Emissions Attestation Engagement and Report Requirements (Item 1506(a)(2) and (c)) a. Proposed Rules The proposed rules would have required the attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be included in the separately- captioned “ Climate -Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing and provided pursuant to standards that are publicly available at no cost and are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the fr amework for public comment. 1409 The Commission explained that the proposed requirement that the standards be established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures would be similar to the requirements for determining a suitable, recognized control framework for use in management’s evaluation of an issuer’s ICFR because in both cases a specific framework is not prescribed but minimum requirements for what constitutes a suitable framework are provided. 1410 The Commission stated 1407 See 17 CFR 229.1505. 1408 See 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3)(A) (providing that “no person, other than the issuer, shal l be liable as provided therein who shall sustain the burden of proof . . . as regards any part of the registrant statement not purporting to be made on the authority of an expert . . . he had, after reasonable investigation, reasonable ground to believe a nd did believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein no t misleading . . .”). 1409 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1410 See id. (citing 17 C FR240.13a -15(c) and 240.15d- 15(c) (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). proposed Item 1504 would meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under the prevailing attestation standard.1462 One commenter stated that, in addition to referencing proposed Item 1504, the attestation report should refer to “the (publicly available) standard used by the registrant to determine the emissions.”1463 In the Proposing Release, the Commission included a request for comment asking if it requires or permits a registrant to use the GHG Protocol as the methodology for determining GHG emissions, would the provisions of the GHG Protocol qualify as “suitable criteria” against which the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated.1464 A number of commenters agreed that if the Commission required or permitted a registrant to use the GHG Protocol as the methodology for determining GHG emissions, the provisions of the GHG protocol would qualify as “suitable criteria.” 1465 On the other hand, one commenter stated that “the reporting standards are not fully developed enough to establish criteria for reliability measuring GHG emissions.” 1466 c. Final Rules We are adopting the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report requirements with some modifications from the proposal.1467 Consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(2)) provide that the attestation report must be provided pursuant to standards that 1462 See, e.g. , letters from ERM CVS; Futurepast; and Mazars. 1463 See letter from ERM CVS. 1464 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1465 See letter from Anthesis Grp.; CRS (stating that, in general, “the market- based methodology for Scope 2 accounting as found in 2015 GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance would qualify as suitabl e criteria against which Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated”); D. Hileman Consulting; ERM CVS; Futurepast; KPMG; Mazars; PwC; WBCSD; and WRI. 1466 See letter from Travelers. 1467 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2), (c). are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures, including the br oad distribution of the framework for public comment.1468 Most commenters who discussed this aspect of the proposal supported the proposed requirement related to due process procedures,1469 and we continue to believe that requiring the attestation report to be provided pursuant to standards that are established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures would help to ensure that the standards upon which the attestation engagement and report are based are the result of a transparent, public, and reasoned process. 1470 As the Commission stated in the Proposing Release, this requirement should also help to protect investors who may rely on the attestation report by limiting the standards to those that have been sufficiently developed. 1471 The propos ed rules also would have required the attestation standards to be publicly available at no cost. We received feedback from some commenters indicating that including such a requirement in the final rules would preclude the use of certain standards that are currently widely used by GHG emissions attestation providers with respect to voluntary assurance over GHG emissions disclosures but that are not publicly available for free. 1472 After consideration of this feedback, the final rules will require that the at testation report be provided pursuant to standards that , in addition to being developed using due process, are either (i) publicly available at no cost, or (ii) widely used for GHG emissions assurance.1473 In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that open access is an important consideration 1468 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2) . 1469 See supra note 1423 and accompanying text. 1470 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1471 See id. 1472 See supra note 1428 and accompanying text. 1473 See 17 CFR 229.1506(a)(2). when determining the suitability of attestation standards because it enables investors to evaluate the report against the requirements of the attestation standard.1474 We continue to believe that open access is an important consideration for the reasons the Commission previously stated; however, we also recognize that the benefits provided by open access may also exist when a standard is widely used in the mar ketplace such that registrants, GHG emissions attestation providers, and investors have significant experience using, or evaluating disclosure assured pursuant to, that standard. In addition, it is important to recognize the value that investors have found in the voluntary assurance services currently being provided with respect to climate and GHG emissions disclosures. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to c ontinue to use assurance standards they are already using for their voluntary disclosures, assuming that those standards meet the due process requirement. 1475 This approach will not only reduce the costs of complying with the final rules1476 but will likely b enefit investors by leveraging the experience that GHG emissions attestation providers already have with particular standards, which could lead to assurance engagements being performed with a greater level of skill initially than if GHG emissions attestation providers were required to gain expertise with an unfamiliar standard. Several commenters agreed with the Commission’s statement in the Proposing Release that the attestation standards of the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB would meet the proposed 1474 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1475 Registrants and GHG emissions attesta tion providers would also need to meet the other requirements included in the final rules relating to the level and scope of the engagement and the expertise and independence of the provider, among other requirements. 1476 See letter from Futurepast (sta ting that one benefit of having non- accounting firm attestation providers provide assurance pursuant to ISO or IAASB ISAE standards is that it would make “ available to registrants a much larger pool of potential service providers,” which “will enhance competition and likely result in lower costs to registrants”). attestation standard requirements.1477 We continue to be of the view that the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB standards meet the due process requirements and are publicly available at no cost to investors. In addition, in light of our modifications to the final rules, we also believe that the ISO standards related to the attestation of GHG emissions disclosures would meet these requirements. We agree with those commenters that stated the process the ISO undertakes for the development of its standards is consistent with due pr ocess requirement included in the final rules. 1478 The ISO TC 207/SC7 is the technical committee responsible for the development of ISO 14064- 3 – Greenhouse gases – Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of greenhouse gas s tatements.1479 The committee includes members from 120 countries, each represented by the country’s national standards body, and the committee also liaises with 32 organizations who monitor standards development activities and can provide input during standards development. 1480 Members organize consultations among stakeholders in 1477 See supra note 1432 and accompanying text. The PCAOB has announced an ongoing project to evaluate its attestation standards for purposes of developing any potential recommendation to amend, consolidate or eliminate certain standards as appropriate. See PCAOB, Attestation Standards Update (Updated Sept. 26, 2022), available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/standard- setting -research -projects/attestatio n- standards -update . The AICPA included its attestation standards as an active project under consideration on its 2022- 23 strategy work plan. See AICPA, 2022 -23 ASB strategy work plan, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards /auditattest/asb/downloadabledocuments/2022 - 2023 -asb-strategy -work -plan.pdf . 1478 See supra notes 1445 and 1446 and accompanying text. 1479 See ISO/TC 207/SC7, About us, available at https://committee.is o.org/home/tc207sc7. More generally, the ISO is a non- governmental organization established in 1947 and based in Geneva, Switzerland. Its mission is to promote the development of standardization and related activities in the world with a view to facilitating the international exchange of goods and services, and to developing cooperation in the spheres of intellectual, scientific, technological and economic activity. See ANSI, U.S. Representation in ISO, available at https://www.ansi.org/iso/us -representation -in-iso/introduction . ISO is composed of representatives from 170 national standards bodies. See ISO, About us, available at https://www.iso.org/about -us.html . 1480 See letter from USTAG TC207. The 32 organizations include the European Commission, International Accred itation Forum, International Chamber of Commerce, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, World Health Organization, and World Trade Organization, among others. See id . their country to develop a national position on ISO standards.1481 The ISO member from the United States is ANSI and it publishes on its website a listing of draft ISO standards that are open to public comment.1482 Moreover, ISO follows a consensus process for approval of its standards.1483 This multi- stakeholder process, which includes an opportunity for public comment on proposed standards, is consistent with the reasoned and transparent process the Commission described in the Proposing Release as being the foundation for standards that a re sufficiently developed. This leads us to the conclusion that ISO standards align with the due process requirement in the final rules. As commenters have noted, ISO standards are not available for free. The ISO standards are, however, widely used for GHG emissions assurance. For example, a recent report determined that for S&P 500 companies that voluntarily obtained assurance over their climate - related disclosures, including in many cases GHG emissions disclosures, the most common standard referenced by non- accounting firm GHG emission attestation providers was ISO 14064- 3. 1484 Specifically, the report found that ISO standards were used in connection with 196 out of a total 346 engagements.1485 This frequency of use aligns with the “ widely used” criteri a in the final rules. It is important to note that by highlighting these standards, we do not mean to imply that other standards, either those currently in existence, or those that may develop in the future, would not be suitable for use under the final rules. Commenters recommended a number of 1481 See id. 1482 See ANSI Standards Action, available at https://www.ansi.org/resource -center/standards -action . 1483 See ISO, Developing standards, available at http s://www.iso.org/developing -standards.html . 1484 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023) (providing statistics for 2021). 1485 See id. alternative approaches, such as providing a list of acceptable standards,1486 or requiring the use of a particular standard.1487 Although we considered these alternatives, we ultimately agreed with those commenters who stated that the Commission should take a flexible approach to the acceptable standards in recognition that more than one suitable standard exists, and others could develop in the future . 1488 The final rules (Item 1506(c)) require the form and content of the GHG emissions attestation report to follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards used, as proposed; however, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules do not prescribe minimum report requirements. 1489 The Commission expla ined in the Proposing Release that the proposed minimum components were all common elements of current assurance reports,1490 a point that was affirmed in the feedback we received from commenters.1491 We continue to expect that the attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules will generally 1486 See supra note 1430 and accompanying text. See also letter from Climate Risk Consortia (recommending that the Commission permit the use of “the standards accepted by the CDP”). 1487 See supra notes 1433 , 1435, 1437, and 1439 and accompanying text. 1488 See supra note 1428 and accompanying text. For example, in the Proposing Release, the Commission included a request for comment asking if AccountAbility’s AA 1000 Series of St andards would meet the proposed requirements for attestation standards. We received one comment that stated the final rule should be written in a way that is inclusive of all standards, including AA1000, among others, but the commenter did not provide any substantiative reasons why AA1000 would meet the proposed criteria . See letter from Climate Risk Consortia. Another commenter stated that the process for developing the AA1000 standard would not meet the proposed due process requirements . See letter from ERM CVS. Although the feedback we received from commenters was mixed, t o the extent that the AA1000 stand ard meets the criteria in the final rule, registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers would not be precluded from using it in connection with complying with the final rules . The staff of the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants about whether a particular standard meets the requirements in the final rules. 1489 See 17 CFR 229.1506(c). 1490 The Commission explained in the Proposing Release that it primarily derived the proposed requirements from the AIC PA’s attestation standard (e.g., SSAE No. 18), which are largely similar to the report requirements under PCAOB AT -101 and IAASB ISAE 3410. See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1491 See supra note 279 and accompanying text. include all of the elements that were proposed.1492 Therefore, the benefit of including the proposed minimum requirements would be marginal , at best, and could be viewed as redundant and adding unneces sary complexity and associated burde ns to the final rules. Instead, simply requiring the attestation report to follow the form and content requirements of the attestation standard or standards should provide investors with important information about the attestation engagement in a consistent and comparable manner. Nevertheless, in light of this shift to a more principles -based approach, to the extent that a particular attestation standard does not include elements sufficiently similar to those commonly included in an assurance report, the GHG emissions attestation provider should consider including such information in its attestation report to facilitate investors’ understanding of the nature and scope of the engagement. Although some commenters suggeste d additional minimum requirements that could be included in the final rules, 1493 we decided against including any additional requirements for the same reason. A few commenters asked the Commission to clarify the level of assurance that is required for his torical periods in a registrant’s filing.1494 We are therefore clarifying that the final rules apply on a prospective basis only with disclosure for historical periods phasing in over time. Specifically, in the first year that an AF or LAF is required to provide an attestation report, such report is only required to cover the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for its most recently completed fiscal year. To the extent the AF or LAF disclosed Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for a historical period, it would not be required to obtain an assurance report covering such historical period in the first year of the attestation rule’s applicability. However, for each 1492 See supra note 1490. See also ISO 14064- 3, §§ 6.3.2 and 9.3. 1493 See supra note 1458 and accompanying text. 1494 See, e.g. , letters from Deloitte & Touche (requesting that the Commission clarify the level of assurance that is required for historical periods); and Grant Thornton (same). subsequent fiscal year’s annual report, the registrant will be required to provide an attestation report for an additional fiscal year until an attestation report is provided for the entire period covered by the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures. In circumstances where more than one GHG emissions provider may have provided an attestation report for the different fiscal years included in the filing, a GHG emis sions attestation provider should be clear about its involvement with any historical information, including disclaiming any such involvement where applicable. 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criteria” against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be “suitable.” 1497 Suitable criteria, when followed, will result in reasonably consistent measurement or evaluation of the registrant’s disclosure that is within the scope of the engagement. 1498 Consistent with commenter feedback, Item 1505 of Regulation S -K will satisfy the suitable criteria requirements of the prevailing attestation s tandards because the proposed requirements set forth relevant, 1495 This guidance parallels similar practices in the context of the fin ancial statement audit. See, e.g. , PCAOB AS 3101, The Auditor's Report on an Audit of Financial Statements When the Auditor Expresses an Unqualified Opinion, paragraph 18h, available at https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/auditing- standards/details/AS 3101. 1496 See supra note 1462 and accompanying text. 1497 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1498 Characteristics of suitable criteria include relevance, objectivity, measurability, and completeness. See, e.g., AICPA SSAE No. 18, AT -C §105.A16 and A42; AICPA SSAE No. 21, AT -C §105.A16 and .A44. In addition to relevance and completeness, the character istics of suitable criteria under IAASB ISAE 3000.A23 include reliability, neutrality and understandability. Therefore, despite the differences in the characteristics listed, the underlying concepts and objectives are consistent. objective standards that call for measurable and complete disclosure of GHG emissions that would allow for a consistent evaluation of the registrant’s disclosure.1499 In addition, in response to a question from a commenter,1500 we are clarifying that a report that states the GHG emissions attestation provider is disclaiming an opinion on the GHG emissions would not constitute compliance by the AF or LAF with the requirement to obtain an attestation report over its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions under the final rules. Consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules do not require a registrant to obtain an attestation report specifically covering the effectiveness of internal control over GHG e missions disclosure. 1501 Such a report would not be required even when the GHG emissions attestation engagement is performed at a reasonable assurance level. As explained in the Proposing Release, given the current evolving state of GHG emissions reporting and assurance, existing DCP obligations and the requirement that AFs and LAFs (initially) obtain at least limited assurance of such disclosure are appropriate first steps toward enhancing the reliability of GHG emissions disclosure. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol’s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia” against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. See supra note 1366 and accompanying text. 1500 See letter from Grant Thornton. 1501 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3. 1502 See id. Under prevailing attestation standards for limited assurance engagements, the testing of and attestation over internal controls are not required. See, e.g. , AICPA SSAE No. 22, AT -C § 210.A16. With respect to reasonable assurance, while there are requirements under prevailing attestation standards to consider and obtain an understanding of internal controls, there is no required attestation of the effectiveness of internal contr ols such as that included in s ection 404(b) of the Sarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes -Oxley Act). See 15 U.S.C. 7262(b) (requiring a registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues an audit report for certain issuers to attest to, and report o n, the assessment made by the management of the issuer with respect to internal controls). Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing. Therefore, the final rules do not re quire a registrant to include an attestation report in such a section, although a registrant may choose to do so. One commenter asked the Commission to clarify whether, to the extent the Commission permits the use of standards other than those developed by the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB, the Commission should clarify “whether all practitioners should be required to consider ‘other information’ in the same way as CPAs.” 1503 The GHG emissions attestation provider must perform the engagement in accordance with t he requirements included in the attestation standard being used. We are clarifying that, to the extent an attestation standard requires an attestation provider to consider ‘other information,’ then the provider would be required to comply with such a requ irement to perform the engagement in accordance with the standard. One commenter stated that, due to the proposed phase in for the assurance requirements, an LAF or AF may be required to obtain assurance over its GHG emissions disclosures, while its consolidated public subsidiaries are not (or not yet) subject to the same level of assurance. 1504 This commenter asked the Commission to consider clarifying whether the consolidated subsidiary is expected to obtain assurance based on the requirements of its parent entit y or entities , and if not , how the assurance provider for the parent entity or entities would report the level of assurance provided over the individual compone nts of the reporting entity. 1505 In response to the specific factual scenario raised by this commenter , we are clarifying that the consolidated information included in the parent company’s Commission filing would need to 1503 See letter from KPMG. 1504 See letter from Grant Thornton. 1505 See id. comply with the final rules’ require ments applicable to the parent company . This means that a subsidiary’s information that is part of the consolidated reporting of its parent company will need to be assured as part of the assurance over the parent company’s consolidated reporting even if the consolidated subsidiary itself is not subject to assurance. This is consistent with how the auditing standards over consolidated financial statements generally apply. Along similar lines, a nother commenter stated that there might be instances where a subsidiary of a registrant has a separate attestation engagement performed over its GHG emissions data to meet local statutory or jurisdictional requirements and the subsidiary might choose an attestation provider at the local level that differs from the attestation provider retained to perform the assurance required under the Commission’s rules. 1506 This commenter stated, for example, if a subsidiary’s attestation engagement was performed by a n accounting firm provider that used AICPA standards, then AICPA attestation standards would allow the provider performing the assurance required under the Commission’s rules to use the work of another practitioner; however, AICPA standards do not address the ability of a n accounting fir m provider to use the work of a non- accountant practitioner , particularly when the non- accountant uses different attestation standards. 1507 Consistent with our response above, we are c larifying that the consolidated information included in the parent company’s Commission filing would need to comply with the final rules’ requirements applicable to the parent compan y. As is the case with other new disclosure requirements, t he Commission staff is available to answer practice questions as registrants begin appl ying the final rules . 1506 See letter from Crowe. 1507 See id. c. Final Rules The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant’s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal.1541 To reduce the burdens on issuers that would have a risen under the proposed rules, and in response to certain commenter feedback described above, we are not adopting a requirement for registrants to disclose (1) whether the attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body to provide assurance; and (2) whether the attestation provider is subject to record -keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement. However, consis tent with the proposal, the final rules (Item 1506(d)) require registrants to disclose whether the GHG emission attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, subject to certain modifications.1542 In addition, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to disclose certain information when there is a change in, and disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider as discussed in greater detail below.1543 The decision not to adopt a requirement for a registrant to disclose whether its GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required, thus re ducing the burden associated with the final rules. Although the existence of a license for a GHG emissions attestation provider that is a certified public accountant is straightforward to determine because certified public accountants and their firms must be registered with s tate boards of 1541 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). 1542 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(1). 1543 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2). accountancy,1544 it may be more difficult for a registrant to determine if a non -accountant GHG emissions attestation provider holds a license. Furthermore, although accreditation and certification organizations exist for GHG emissions attestation providers that are not accountants,1545 it may be difficult for registrants and even GHG emissions attestation providers themselves to determine whether the credential conferred by such organization constitutes a “license,” or if i t is some other type of accreditation or certification. Therefore, we agree with the commenter that pointed out the “absence of a universal certification or credential” likely would make it difficult for registrants to determine whether disclosure is requ ired.1546 We decided not to require a registrant to disclose whether the attestation provider is subject to record -keeping requirements with respect to the work performed for the GHG emissions attestation engagement to reduce burdens on registrants. Upon further consideration, this proposed requirement would seem to have marginal benefit to investors making investment or voting decisions while adding complexity to issuer disclosures. Instead, the final rules focus the disclosure requirements on the more s ignificant disclosure of the existence of an oversight inspection program. 1547 The proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which 1544 See, e.g. , National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, Getting a License, available at https://nasba.org/licensure/gettingacpalicen se/ (explaining the licensure process for certified public accountants and accounting firms by state boards of accountancy). 1545 See, e.g. , letter from ANSI NAB (describing itself as the “only peer recognized accreditation body operating an accreditation program for oversight of greenhouse gas (GHG) validation and verification bodies (attestation providers) in the United States .”). 1546 See letter from ABA. 1547 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). program (or programs).1548 We are adopting this requirement as proposed.1549 In response to commenters ,1550 we are clarifying, for purposes of the final rules, that we would consider a GHG emissions attestation engagement to be subject to an oversight inspection program if it is possible that the assurance services could be inspected pursuant to the oversight pro gram, even if it is not certain that the services will be inspected in a particular inspection cycle. An example of such an oversight inspection program is the AICPA’s peer review program, which includes within its scope attestation engagement s performed by a certified public accountant in accordance with AICPA standards . 1551 Commenters did not offer any examples of oversight inspection programs that would include within their scope GHG emissions attestation engagements performed by non-accountants . Even if no such programs currently exist , it is possible that they could develop in the future given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance practices . Accordingly, we continue to believe that the existence of an oversight inspection program will help inv estors better understand the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider, which in turn will help them determine whether the assurance services have enhanced the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure. In addition to requiring a registr ant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is subject to any oversight inspection program as proposed, the final rules also require a registrant to disclose whether the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to any 1548 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.4. 1549 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). 1550 See supra notes 1532 and 1533 and accompanying text. 1551 Under the AICPA Peer Review Program, firms that are members of the AICPA are required to have a peer review of their accounting and auditing practice once every three years in accordance with the AICPA Standards f or Performing and Reporting on Peer Reviews . The peer review is conducted by an independent evaluator, known as a peer reviewer , who reviews a sample of the firm’s work against the requirements of applicable professional standards in all material respects . See Summary of AICPA Peer Review Program, available at https://us.aicpa.org/research /standards/peerreview/peer -review -summary.html . oversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs ).1552 To be clear, this requirement is not limited to oversight inspection programs that include within their scope, or require the inspection of, the GHG emissions attestation engagement. Rather, the final rules require the disclosure of “any” oversight inspection program that applies to the GHG emissions attestation provider.1553 Therefore, a registrant must disclose any oversight inspection program the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to for any type of engagement (e.g., a financial statement au dit or other review).1554 This additional requirement will provide investors with a better understanding of the qualifications of the GHG emissions attestation provider because such oversight can provide a check on a provider’s overall activities and drive improvements in the quality of their services. 1555 We considered whether to only require disclosure about the existence of oversight inspections programs from registrants who engage GHG emission attestation providers that are 1552 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d). 1553 See id. 1554 Examples of such oversight inspection programs include the AICPA’s peer review program or the PCAOB’s inspection program. The AICPA’s peer review program and PCAOB’s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs that a GHG emissions attestation provider may be subject to generally; however, only the AICPA’s peer review program would include within its scope the GHG emissions attestation engagement. The PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction is limited to audits of issuers and registered brokers and dealers and does not include attestation engagements for GHG emissions disclosure within its scope. See 15 U.S.C. 7214 (setting forth the PCAOB’s inspection jurisdiction). Consistent with our explanation above, commenters did not offer any examples of oversight inspection programs that apply to non- accountant GHG emissions attestation providers . 1555 For exam ple, in the context of inspections of PCAOB -registered public accounting firms, academic literature suggests that engagement -specific PCAOB inspections may have spillover effects on non- inspected engagements. See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement Inspection Process —Preliminary Evidence, 93Acct . Rev. 53, 53-80 (2018) (concluding that “engagement - specific PCAOB inspections influence non -inspected engagements, with spillover effects detected at both partner and office level s” and that “the information communicated by the PCAOB to audit firms is applicable to non- inspected engagements”); Daniel Aobdia, The Economic Consequences of Audit Firms’ Quality Control System Deficiencies , 66 Mgmt . Sci. (2020) (concluding that “common issues identified in PCAOB inspections of individual engagements can be generalized to the entire firm, despite the PCAOB claiming its engagement selection process targets higher risk clients” and that “[PCAOB quality control] remediation also appears to p ositively influence audit quality”) . not registered with the PCAOB , as suggested by some commenters.1556 However, we are concerned that requiring this disclosure only with respect to certain GHG emission attestation providers could result in confusion and believe that requiring registrants to provide such disclosure with r espect to all GHG emissions attestation providers will enhance the consistency and comparability of disclosures. Moreover, to the extent that a particular GHG emissions attestation provider is registered with the PCAOB, we would not expect it to be time c onsuming or difficult for a registrant to make this disclosure, which would presumably remain the same from year -to-year absent any changes to PCAOB rules. We also considered whether to require such disclosure to be included in the attestation report as recommended by one commenter, 1557 instead of requiring the registrant to disclose this information in the filing that includes the attestation report as proposed. We understand that whether the attestation provider is subject to any oversight inspection pr ogram is in the first instance known by the attestation provider rather than the registrant, and therefore it may seem reasonable to require the attestation provider to make the disclosure rather than the registrant. However, we do not expect it would be difficult or burdensome for a registrant to obtain this information from the GHG emissions attestation provider, and in fact, we expect that most registrants would want to know about the existence of an oversight inspection program before retaining an atte station provider in most instances and therefore likely will already have such information in their possession. Moreover, we continue to believe that requiring such disclosure to be included in the attestation report may create confusion because this disc losure may not be required by existing attestation standards. 1556 See supra note 400 and accompanying text. 1557 See supra note 402 and accompanying text. As stated above, the Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing Release asking if it should require disclosure when there is a change in, or disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider that is similar to the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K.1558 The commenters that responded to the request for comment generally agreed with including such a requirement in the final rules.1559 Because we believe that requiring the disclosure of information regarding changes in, and disagreements with, a GHG emissions attestation provider would provide investors with important information about the provider and the conduct of the attestation engagement, which investors need to help them assess the reliability of the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures, we have included a provision in the final rules that will require AFs and LAFs subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose certain inf ormation when the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider resigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re -appointment after completion of the attestation engagement) or is dismissed. 1560 We have generally modeled this aspect of the final ru les on the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K, tailored to fit the context of a GHG emissions attestation engagement and to limit additional burdens.1561 In particular, our decision to require the disclosure in the filing that contains the GHG emissions disclosures and attestation report (e.g., a registration statement or an annual report that requires disclosure pursuant to Item 1558 See Proposing Release, Section II.H.2. 1559 See supra note 1539 and accompanying text. 1560 See 17 CFR 229.1502(d)(2). 1561 Although we have generally modeled these aspects of the final rules on existing requirements , in addition to the substantive differences discussed herein, we have also made several non -substantive changes and updates for readability. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the final rules nor this discussion should be construed as a modification or i nterpretation of the existing requirements on which they were modeled. 1506), instead of an altern ative such as requiring a registrant to provide the disclosure in a Form 8-K, should serve to limit additional burdens associated with this provision. We believe that requiring similar disclosure for GHG emissions attestation providers to be included in t he annual report or registration statement that contains the attestation report is appropriate because it will provide investors with the essential information they need to evaluate the assurance services provided while minimizing the need for additional f ilings by a registrant. Specifically, the final rules (Item 1506(d)(2)) will require an AF or LAF subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose whether its former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned or was dismissed and the date thereof . 1562 If so, the regis trant must state whether during the performance of the attestation engagement for the fiscal year covered by the attestation report there were any disagreements with the former GHG emissions attestation provider over any measurement or disclosure of GHG em ission or attestation scope of procedures.1563 The final rules will require the registrant to describe each such disagreement and state whether the registrant has authorized the former GHG emissions attestation provider to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor GHG emissions attestation provider concerning the subject matter of each such disagreement. 1564 Like the other elements of the disclosure requirement, this is modeled on the requirement to disclose disagreements between a registrant and its independent auditor in connection with the auditor’s dismissal or resignation in Item 304 of Regulation S -K, and just as in that context, it is important that significant disagreements are brought to the 1562 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i). Therefore, the registrant w ill be required to provide disclosure in circumstances where: (1) a GHG emissions attestation provider resigns or is dismiss ed during the fiscal year covered by the attestation report but it does not issue the attestation report; and (2) a GHG emissions attestation provider issues an opinion or conclusion on GHG emissions disclosure for the relevant fiscal year but is dismissed or resigns before the attestation report is filed. 1563 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i)(B). 1564 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(i)(B)(1) -(2). attention of investors.1565 The disclosure of the exist ence of a disagreement in the event of the resignation or dismissal of the GHG emissions attestation provider will enable investors to assess the possible effects of such disagreement and whether it could have impacted the reliability of the GHG emissions disclosure, which, as discussed above, provides investors with information about a registrant’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The final rules also include two instructions defining the term “disagreements” for purposes of the disclosure and explaining the circumstances in which it is sufficient to conclude that a disagreement has been communicated to the registrant. 1566 This definition and explanation is consistent with Item 304 of Regulation S -K and its Instructions , with minor modifications to take into account the circumstances of a GHG emissions attestation engagement.1567 We have determined to take an incremental approach to requiring disclosure about the resignation or dismissal of a GHG emissions attestation provider and therefore have not included a requirement for the registrant to request the former GHG emissions attes tation provider to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the registrant with respect to the resignation or dismissal and disagreement (if applicable). The final rules, howeve r, do not preclude a registrant from disclosing its explanation of the dismissal or resignation to its former GHG emissions attestation provider, and although not required, we encourage any GHG emissions attestation provider to convey concerns it has with the registrant’s description of those events to the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant. 1565 See Registrants and Independent Accountants Amended Rules for Increased Disclosure of Relationships , Release No. 33 -5550 (Dec. 20, 1974) [40 FR 1010, 1011 (Jan. 6, 1975)] . 1566 See 17 CFR 229.1506(d)(2)(ii) -(iii). 1567 See 17 CFR 229.304(a)(1)(iv); and Instructions 4 and 5 to Item 304. The requirement to disclose certain information when a GHG emissions attestation provider resigns or is dismissed only applies to AFs and LAFs that are required to obtain an attestation report pursuant to Item 1506(a). It does not apply if an AF or LAF i s not required to disclose its GHG emissions (and therefore is not required to obtain an attestation report) because the AF or LAF determines that its GHG emissions are not material for a particular fiscal year. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, It em 1506(d)(2) does not apply to registrants that voluntarily obtain assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure and provide certain information about the engagement pursuant to Item 1506(e). We expect that the documentation regarding resignations and di smissals and any disagreements between the registrant and the GHG emissions attestation provider will be readily available to the registrant such that it would not be difficult or costly to comply with this requirement. 5. Disclosure of Voluntary Assurance (Item 1506(e)) a. Proposed Rules The Commission proposed to require a registrant that was not required to include a GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed rules to disclose certain information if the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures were v oluntarily subjected to third- party attestation or verification. 1568 Specifically, the Commission proposed new Item 1505(e) of Regulation S -K to require a registrant to disclose within the separately capt ioned “Climate -Related Disclosure” section in the filing the following information if the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures were subject to third -party attestation or verification: (i) Identify the provider of such assurance or verification; (ii) Describe the assurance or verification standard used; 1568 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.5. parties.1671 Anothe r commenter stated that there should be a meaningful safe harbor for the entirety of any final rule considering the “ unique ” challenges that registrants must overcome to meet the proposed climate -related disclosure obligations .1672 3. Final Rule s Because the final rules will not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions from any registrant,1673 we are not adopting a safe harbor for such disclosures in the final rules. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3 emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute “forward -looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : • 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); • 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); • 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and • 17 CFR 229.1504 (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro m CEMEX. 1672 See letter from AXPC. 1673 See supra s ection II.H.3. 1674 See supra note 1639 and accompanying text. 1675 See 17 CFR 229. 1507(a)(1). excluded from the PSLRA safe harbors in subparagraphs ( a) and (b) of s ection 27A of the Securities Act and s ection 21E of the Exchange Act . When proposing the climate disclosure rules, the Commission indicated that, because transition planning, scenario analysis, and internal carbon pricing involve assumptions, judgments, and predictions about future events, the PSLRA safe harbors would be applicable to forward -looking statements concerning transition plans, scenario analysis , and internal carbon pricing. 1676 Moreover, because the proposed targets and goals disclosure provision would require a registrant to disclose how it intends to achieve its climate -related targets or goals, the Commission similarly stated that the PSLRA sa fe harbors would apply to forward -looking statements made in the context of such targets and goals disclosure.1677 Because estimates and assumptions based on future events are intrinsically involved in disclosures concerning a registrant’s transition plan, use of scenario analysis or internal carbon pricing, and targets and goals, we continue to believe that such disclosures constitute “forward- looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors. The PSLRA statutory provisions define “forward -looking statement” to include a number of different types of statements.1678 Several of these definitional provisions are potentially applicable to statements made in the context of disclosures regarding transition plans, scenario analysis, and internal carbon pri cing made pursuant to Item 1502 and regarding targets and goals made pursuant to Item 1504. T o the extent that disclosures made in response to these Items or to 1676 See Proposing Release, s ections II.C and E. 1677 See Proposing Release, s ection II.I. 1678 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(i)(1). any other s ubpart 1500 provision contain one or more of the following statements, they w ill fall within the PSLRA statutory definition of “forward- looking statement ”: • A statement containing a projection of revenues, income (including income loss), earnings (including earnings loss) per share, capital expenditures, capital structure, or other financ ial items ;1679 • A statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans or objectives relating to the products or services of the issuer ;1680 • A statement of future economic performance, including any such statement contained in a discussi on and analysis of financial condition by the management , made pursuant to Commission rules;1681 • Any statement of the assumptions underlying or relating to the above statements;1682 and • A statement containing a projection or estimate of items specified by Comm ission rule or regulation.1683 If a forward -looking statement falls squarely within any of the above -described forward- looking statements, certain parties may rely on the existing PSLRA safe harbors for disclosures made pursuant to any of the s ubpart 1500 provisions , assuming the other requirements of the 1679 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1) (A) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(i)(1)(A). For example, a statement of potential capital expenditures made in response to Item 1502(e) (transition plans) and Item 1502(d) (narrative discussion of material impacts of climate -related risks ) would likely constitute a forward -looking statement. 1680 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1)( B) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(i)(1)(B ). For example, a statement of plans to transiti on to more efficient operations or a different mix of products or ser vices made in response to Item 1502( d), Item 1502( e), or Item 1504 (targets and goals) would likely constitute a forward- looking statement . 1681 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1)( C) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(i)(1)(C ). For example, a statement of future economic performance made pursuant to Items 1502(d), Item 1504, or Item 303 of Regulation S -K would likely constitute a forward -looking statement. 1682 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1)( D) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(i)(1)(D ). 1683 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(i)(1)( F) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(i)(1)(F ). For example, a projection or estimate of a registrant’s future GHG emissions made pursuant to Item 1504 would likely constitute a forward- looking statement. PSLRA provisions are met .1684 We recognize, however, the concern of some commenters that the PSLRA safe harbors may not be applicable to disclosures related to transition plans, scenario analysis, internal c arbon price, and targets and goals to the extent the disclosures consist of a complex mix of factual and forward -looking statements and because the PSLRA safe harbors do not apply to certain parties and certain transactions.1685 In addition to the forward -looking statement exemptions expressly provided under the PSLRA , the Commission has authority under the PSLRA to provide exemptions from liability for other statements based on projections or other forward- looking information if the Commission dete rmines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.1686 The Commission previously exercised this authority when it adopted a rule providing a forward- looking statement safe harbor for certain statements made co ncerning market risk.1687 After considering feedback from commenters, we have concluded that using the authority provided by the PSLRA to extend its protections to disclosures (other than historical facts) concerning transition plans, scenario analysis, i nternal carbon pricing, and targets and goals is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors . We expect that t he disclosures 1684 Other safe harbor s, such as Securities Act Rule 175 and Exchange Act Rule 3b -6 and the bespeaks caution doctrine may also continue to apply to disclosures made pursuant to any of the subpart 1500 provisions, depending on specific facts and circumstances. 1685 See, e.g. , letters from BOA; and Chamber. For example, the PSLRA safe harbors do not apply to statements made in connection with an IPO , see 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(b)(2)(D) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(b)(2)(D), or made in connection with an offering by, or related to the operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program, see 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(b)(2)(E ) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(b)(2)(E ). 1686 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(g) and 15 U .S.C. 78u -5(g). The PSLRA also provides that it does not limit, “either expressly or by implication, the authority of the Commission to exercise similar authority or to adopt similar rules and regulations with respect to forward -looking statements under a ny other statute under which the Commission exercises rulemaking authority.” 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(h) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(h). 1687 17 CFR 229.305; s ee Disclosure of Market Risk Sensitive Instruments Release. required by these items will include a complex mixture of both forward -looking and factual information rel ated to climate -related risk s and assumptions concerning those risks. Thus, we are providing a safe harbor for these disclosures to avoid having to disent angle the information to claim protection for forward -looking statements under the PSLRA safe harbor s, which would increase the compliance burden under the final rules and potentially reduce the usefulness of those disclosures for investors . We also believe that a safe harbor for these disclosures wi ll help incentivize more comprehensive disclosures on these matters to the benefit of investors.1688 Statements made by i ssuers and /or in connection with transactions1689 currently excluded from the PSLRA statutory safe harbor for forward -looking statements that will be eligible for the final rule s’ safe harbor include forward -looking statements : made in connection with an offering of securities by a blank check company;1690 made with respect to the business or operations of an issuer of penny stock; made in connection with a rollup transaction; or made in connection with an IPO,1691 or in connection with an offering by, or relating to the operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program.1692 1688 See supra note 1640 and accompanying text. 1689 In addition to issuers, consistent with the PSLRA safe harbors, the safe harbor will apply to: a person acting on behalf of the issuer; an outside reviewer retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of the issuer; or an underwriter, with respect to information provided by the issuer or information derived from information provided by the issuer . See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(a)(2)-(4) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(a)(2)-(4); see also infra note 1691. 1690 The Commission recently amended Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b- 2 to define “blank check company” for purposes of Securities Act Section 27A and Exchange Act Section 21E to mean a company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person. See Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and Projections , Release No. 33 -11265 ( Jan. 24, 2024) , [89 FR 14158 (Feb. 26, 2024)] . 1691 The limitation in 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(a)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(a)(1) is not applicable. See Item 1507(a)(3). Thus, notwithstanding 15.U.S.C. 77z(2)(a)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78(u)(a)(1), the safe harbor will apply where an issuer that, at the time the statement is made, is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act . 1692 See 17 CFR 229.1507 (a)(2). We have determined that it is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors to extend the safe harbor to these entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies, and to transactions, such as IPOs, all of which are cu rrently excluded from the PSLRA statutory s afe harbor for forward -looking statements , because such entities may be subject to material climate -related risks th at will require them to provide the disclosures pursuant to Items 1502(e), (f), or (g), or Item 1504. Extending the PSLRA safe harbor to these specified disclosures will encourage more comprehensive disclosures under these Items and help limit any negative effects to capital formation that may re sult from the perceived compliance costs associated with these provisions of the final rules .1693 Because the disclosure items pertaining to transition plans, scenario analysis, internal carbon pricing, and targets and goals are likely to involve a complex mixture of estimates and assumptions, some of which may be based on a combination of facts and projections, the safe harbor we are adopting provides that all information required by the s ubpart 1500 provisions concerning transition plans, scenario analysis, internal carbon pricing, and targets and goals is considered forward -looking statements for purposes of the statutory PSLRA safe harbors, except for historical facts. 1694 This provision should encourage more comprehensive disclosures 1693 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(b)(1)(B)- (D) and 77z -2(b)(2)(C)- (E); and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(b)(1)(B)- (D) and 78u- 5(b)(2)(C)- (E). We are not using our exemptive authority to extend the PSLRA safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(A) (specified “bad actors”); (ii) forward looking -statements contained in a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company as specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(B); and (iii) forward -looking statements made by an issuer in a going- private transaction, see section 27A(b)(1)(E) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(E), in connection with a tender offer, see Securities Act section 27A(b)(2)(C) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(C), or in a beneficial ownership report required to be filed pursuant to s ection 13(d) of the Exchange Act, see Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(F) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(F). See also the discussion below of forward- looking statements made in consolidated financial statements, which are excluded from both the PSLRA and Item 1507 safe harbors. 1694 See 17 CFR 229.1507 (b). The Commission adopted a similar provision in the market risk disclosure context. See 17 CFR 229.305(d)(2)(i). regarding these s ubpart 1500 items , to the benefit of inves tors, despite their novelty and complexity. Consistent with the operation of the PSLRA safe harbor , the final rules’ forward -looking safe harbor will not be available for statements consisting solely of historical fact because such information does not involve the assumptions, judgments, and predictions about future events that necessitates additional protections .1695 The safe harbor provision provides as non- exclusive examples of historical facts that are excluded from the safe harbor information related to carbon offsets or RECs described pursuant to a target or goal and a registrant’s statemen ts in response to Item 1502(e) (transition plan disclosure) or Item 1504 (targets and goals disclosure ) about material expenditures actually incurred.1696 Like the terms of a material contract, parties covered by the safe harbor should know with reasonable certainty information about a purchased carbon offset or REC , such as the amount of carbon avoidance, reduction, or removal represented by the offset or the amount of generated renewable energy represented by the REC, as well as the nature and source of the offset or REC, and should not need the protection of a forward -looking safe harbor if those items are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1504.1697 Similarly , statemen ts in response to Item 1502(e) (transition plan disclosure) and Item 1504 (targets and goals disclosure) about material expenditures actually incurred will not be eligible for the Item 1507 safe harbor because those statements consist of historical facts. The PSLRA safe harbor does not apply to forward- looking statements included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 1695 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(a) and 15 U.S.C. 78u -5(a). 1696 See 17 CFR 229.1507 (b). 1697 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). (“GAAP”) .1698 Consistent with th is, the final rules’ safe harbor will not be available for forward - looking statements included in a registrant’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, any such forward -looking statements that are incorporated by refer ence from the financial statements into a registrant’s subpart 1500 disclosures will not be eligible for the Item 1507 safe harbor. Notwithstanding deeming certain disclosures to be “forward -looking statements” and expanding the PSLRA protections to include certain issuers and transactions under Item 1507, the rest of the PSLRA requirements apply to the Item 1507 safe harbor. For examp le, in order for the safe harbor protections to apply, a forward -looking statement must be accompanied by a meaningful cautionary statement that identif ies important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward -looking statement.1699 Although some commenters asked the Commission to include Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosures within the scope of any safe harbor, we decline to follow this recommendation.1700 Because the methodologies underlying the calculation of those scopes are fairly well - established,1701 we do not believe that it is necessary to provide a safe harbor from private litigation for such disclosures. We also decline to extend the safe harbor t o Commission enforcement actions because existing Securities Act Rule 175 and Exchange Act Rule 3b- 6 already provide a suitable safe harbor from liability for forward- looking statements in certain Commission enforcement actions.1702 1698 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(b)(2)(B) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(b)(2)(B). 1699 See 15 U.S.C. 77z -2(c)(1)(A) and 15 U.S.C. 78u- 5(c)(1)(A). 1700 See supra note 1651 and accompanying text. 1701 See, e.g. , supra note 916 and accompanying text. 1702 Securities Act Rule 175 and Exchange Act Rule 3b- 6 also apply to private litigation. Although some commenters recommended that we sunset any safe harbor,1703 we decline to follow this recommendation at this time. The Commission may determine at a future date, after assessing how disclosure practices have evolved , whether it makes sense to amend or remove the safe harbor. K. Financial Statement Effect s (Article 14) 1. Introduction The Commission proposed amendments to Regulation S -X that would require certain disclosures in registrants’ financial statements. Specifically, the Commission proposed that if a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by proposed s ubpart 1500 in a f iling that also requires audited financial statements, then the registrant would be required to disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated financial statement metrics.1704 The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: • Financial Impact Metrics;1705 • Expenditure Metrics; and • Financial Estimates and Assumptions.1706 The proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required disclosure of the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions and any efforts to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on the line items in a registrant’s financial 1703 See supra note 1664 and accompanying text. 1704 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. 1705 The Proposing Release and the proposed rules used the term “metrics” to describe the proposed Regulation S-X amendments, including the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics. See Proposing Release, s ection II.F. The final rules do not use the term “metrics” to describe the Regulation S -X amendments because we think it is more accurate to characterize them as disclosures of financial statement effects. See 17 CFR 210.14 -01, 14 -02. 1706 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. flows have been capitalized, which the commenter stated would provide an understanding of real cash-flow impacts that could be more directly linked to the Regulation S -K disclosures and would be more useful for investors.1937 One commenter stated that the Commission should consider amending its industry guides for the oil and gas industry, among others, to require better disclosure of the financial statement impacts of climate change.1938 c. Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, including those expressing significant concerns about the burdens associated with this aspect of the proposal, we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. 1939 While the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided additional transparency for investors , we were persuaded by those commenter s that stated the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would be burdensome and costly for registrants because of the updates that would be necessary to internal systems and processes. 1940 Therefore, at this time, we have chosen not to adopt these disclosures . These conc erns led us to adopt a significantly narrower set of requirements that are focused on requiring the disclosure of a discrete set of actual expenses that registrants incur and can attribute to severe weather events and other natural conditions. In line with the views of certain commenters, 1941 we expect these 1937 See letter from CFA Institute. 1938 See letter from Ceres (recommending that the Commission also consider also expanding its industry guides for mining, bank holding companies, real estate limited partnerships, and property- casualty insurance underwriters). The industry guides for oil and gas, mining, and bank and savings and loan companies have been codified by the Commission. See 17 CFR 229.1201 through 1208 (oil and gas); 17 CFR 229.1300 through 1305 (mining); and 17 CFR 229.1401 through 1406 (bank and savings and loan). 1939 As discussed in greater detail below, since we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, a registrant will not have the option to disclose the impact of any climate -related opportunities on the Financial Impact Metrics. See infra s ection II.K.5.c. For the same reason, we are not adopting the requirement set forth in proposed Rule 14- 02(i) requiring a registrant to include the impacts of any climate - related risks identified pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on the Financial Impact Metrics. 1940 See supra note 1791 and accompanying text. 1941 See supra notes 1924 and 1926 and accompanying text. requirements to be more feasible for registrants to disclose under current financial reporting processes . Moreover, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s,1942 the requirements we are adopting will provide many of the same benefits of transparency and insights that the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided, albeit without as much detail, which should reduce the burden on registrants. In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii , we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants ’ financial reporting obligations .1943 Therefore , a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. Our decisio n not to adopt the proposed Financial Impact Metrics does not a ffect registrants ’ ongoing responsibility to consider material impacts , including those that may be climate -related, when preparing their financial statements and related disclosures. Although we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics at this time, certain aspects of the proposed rules discussed at length above also applied to , or were substantially similar to , the proposed Expenditure Metrics. For example, the proposed one perc ent disclosure threshold and terminology such as “severe weather events and other natural conditions” were 1942 See supra note s 1732 and 1735. 1943 See infra note s 2068 and 2069 and accompanying text . included in the proposals for both proposed metrics.1944 A number of commenters provided feedback on these issues generally, without indicating that their comments were limited to only the proposed Financial Impact Metrics or to only the proposed Expenditure Metrics.1945 In addition, some of the alternatives discussed above are relevant to the proposed Expenditure Metrics.1946 As such, w e also considered these comments with respect to the proposed Expenditure Metrics. Below, our discussion focuses on additional issues that commenters raised with respect to the proposed Expenditure Metrics . As a result, our rationale for the final rules takes into consideration all of the commenter feedback we received on the proposed rules. 3. Expenditure Effects a. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to amend Regulation S -X to require a registrant to disclose Expenditure Metrics. As proposed, the Expenditure Metrics referred to the positive and negative impacts associated with the same severe weather events, other natural condi tions, transition activities, and identified climate -related risks as the proposed Financial Impact M etrics.1947 Registrants would have been required to separately aggregate the amounts of (i) expenditures expensed and (ii) capitalized costs incurred during the fiscal years presented. 1948 For each of 1944 See Proposing Release, s ections II.F.2 and 3. 1945 See, e.g. , letters from B. Herron (opposing the 1% disclosure threshold generally without distinguishing between the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics); Moody’s (“[W ]e therefore suggest the Commission dispense with the one -percent rule in favor of a more principles -based approach for reporting any financial statement metrics.”); and Sens. J. Reed et al. (stating its support for the 1% disclosure threshold without dist inguishing between the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the proposed Expenditure Metrics). 1946 See supra s ection II.K.2.b.iv. 1947 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 1948 The Proposing Release explained that the se metrics are focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s), and it stated that the number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of income statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements. See id. rules should a ddress how the costs should be presented in that circumstance.1989 Similarly, one commenter asserted that whether something is identified as an expenditure or a capitalized cost would require registrants to make subjective judgments that are unlikely to be uniform across industries.1990 Another commenter warned that a registrant could “game” the rules by classifying costs as expenditures, rather than capitalizing the costs , to avoid triggering the disclosure threshold.1991 Some commenters generally asked the C ommission to provide additional examples and guidance for calculating the proposed Expenditure Metrics.1992 c. Final Rule s i. Scope (Rule s 14- 02(c) and (d)) The proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions and related to transition activities . 1993 After consideration of the comments, we are adopting a requirement (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) to disclose expenditures expe nsed and capitalized costs with a number of changes from the proposed rules based on commenter feedback.1994 In response to the concerns identified by commenters above , we have modified the proposed requirements and are adopting final rules that require dis closures that 1989 See id. 1990 See letter from Can. Bankers. 1991 See letter from Sarasin. 1992 See, e.g., letters from J. McClellan (seeking clarification on expensed or capitalized costs partially incurred towards the climate -related events and transition activities); RSM US LLP; and Salesforce (seeking clarification around what constitutes “expenditures incurred for climate -related transition activities related to research and development of new technologies, purchase of assets, infrastructure or products that are intended to reduce G HG emissions, increase energy efficiency, offset emissions (purchase of energy credits), or improve other resource efficiency”). 1993 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 1994 See supra note 1720 and accompanying text. significantly reduce the burdens for registrants while providing investors with decision- useful information. The final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters.1995 Having considered the various alternatives presented by commenters, we concluded that focusing on the disclosure of discrete expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions strikes an appropriate balance between providing investors with useful information and limiting the burdens on registrants. Under the final rules, a registra nt must disclose: (1) The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses, excluding recoveries, incurred during the fiscal year as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, and (2) The aggregate amount of capitaliz ed costs and charges, excluding recoveries, recognized during the fiscal year as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions. 1996 1995 See supra section II.K.2.b.iv. See also letter from Dell (requesting that the “Commission consider limiting Article 14 of Regulation S -X requirement s to physical impacts and related expenditures only”). 1996 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c), (d). Under the final rules, disclosure must be provided for the registrant’s most recently completed fiscal year, and to the extent previously disclosed or required to be disclosed, for the historical fiscal year(s) included in the consolidated financial statements in the filing. See 17 CFR 210.14 - 01(d). In addition, f oreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under home country GAAP and reconcile to U.S. GAAP, would be required to use U.S. GAAP (including the provisions of the final rules) as the basis for calculating and disclosing this information . Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the final rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement effects . See also infra note 2380 which discusses pr oposed amendments to Form 20- F. The proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to “mitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions.”1997 Some commenters indicated that it would be feasible, and significantly less burdensome, to instead segregate and quantify discrete costs incurred due to severe weather events.1998 Requiring disclosure of expenditures related to mitigation activities would present challenges for registrants in terms of forecasting and determining their expectations about future severe weather events at the time they are making expenditure decisions. In addition, c osts and expenditures related to mitigation activities may present similar issues to transition activities , which are discussed in further detail below, because the mitigation of the risks of severe weather events may be only one of several reasons why a company makes a business decision to incur a particular expenditure. Therefore, we have decided to require registrants to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred “as a result of” severe weather events and other natural conditions . 1999 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses that will be disclosed under the final rules are already captured in a registrant’s income statement or balance sheet and measured and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP or 1997 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 1998 See, e.g. , letters from Dow ( stating that direct costs related to property damage and related repair costs as a result of extreme weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast “can easily be segregated, analyzed, and quantified within our current processes”); and Nutrien (stating that if there is a fire at one of its location s that it can attribute to a severe weather event it could “ readily identify costs associated with demolition, clean -up and rebuilding of those physical assets for disclosure” ). 1999 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c) and (d). Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics only required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to the mitigation of risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions , the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions because tho se costs would have constituted line -item impacts to a registrant’s financial statements. Therefore, the requirement to disclose co sts and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions is a subset of the information that was included in the proposal. IFRS.2000 Thus , this approach will be less costly and burdensome for registrants as compared to the proposed rules . In response to commenter requests for additional clarity,2001 we are prescribing an attribution principle that registrants must use to determine whether a capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss is “as a result of” a severe weather event or other natural condition.2002 The attribution principle will also simplify the determination of the amount required to be dis closed by eliminating the need to allocate portions of costs and expenditures, which will reduce compliance costs for registrants.2003 Under the final rules, t he requirement to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions remain s subject to a one percent disclosure threshold; however, we are modifying the denominators used for the threshold and adopting de minimis thresholds that exempt disclosure of amounts that aggregate to less than $100,000 in the income statement or less than $500,000 in the balance sheet, as explained in greater detail below . 2004 In addition, under the final rules, registrants must separately disclose, as part of the required contextual information, any recoveries resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions to reflect the net 2000 See, e.g. , letter from KPMG (“We recommend that the final rule clarify that the required disclosures are indeed a disaggregation of amounts already recognized in the financial statements.”). 2001 See supra note 1912 and accompanying text. 2002 The attribution principle is discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K. 3.c.iii. See also 17 CFR 210.14 - 02(g). 2003 See id . The attribution principle will also apply to recoveries, which are discussed in greater detail below in section II.K. 3.c.iv. See also 17 CFR 210.14 -02(f) and (g). 2004 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions have on a registrant’s financial statements.2005 As proposed, the Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose separately the aggregate amount of expenditure expensed and the aggregate amount of capitalized costs. 2006 In a shift from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to separately disclose where on the income statement and balance sheet, as applicable, the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented.2007 As explained above, significantly fewer line items are impacted by the final rules we are adopting than would have been impacted by a requirement to disclose the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. Only those line items that reflect capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, and losses fall within the scope of the disclosures, as is further illustrated below in s ection II. K.3.c.vii. For example, we do not expect that gross revenues would be impacted under the final rules . In addition, we do not believe that requir ing registrants to disclose in which line item each of the required capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented will increase the burden as compared to the proposed Expenditure Metrics because the disclosures required under the final rules are simply a disaggregation of financial statement line items. Requiring registrants to separately disclose in which line item the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses are presented will enhance the usefulness of t he disclosures for investors by allowing them to understand the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions on a registrant ’s 2005 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). See infra s ection II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose contextual information . 2006 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2007 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c), (d), and (e)(1). financial position and performance. This information will facilitate their analyses and cash flow projections year -on-year and across registrants. The proposed r ules would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks. 2008 With respect to transition activities, many commenters pointed out that registrants make business decisions, such as incurring an expenditure to purchase a piece of machinery that is more energy efficient, for multiple reasons, and as a result, a registrant’s transition activities may be inextricably intertwined with its ordinary business activities. 2009 Consequently, commenters raised concerns about registrants’ abilities to identify, attribute, and quantify the impact of transition activities on the financial statemen ts. 2010 In addition, requiring disclosure for transition activities would present challenges for registrants in terms of forecasting and determining their expectations about transition activities at the time they are making expenditure decisions. Taking the se comments into consideration, we have determined not to require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures related to general transition activities in the financial statements at this time. Although we are not adopting the broader requirement for di sclosure of transition activities in the financial statements , registrants will be required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs in the financial statements .2011 The proposed rules identified the amount of expense d or capitalized 2008 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2009 See supra note 1892 and accompanying text. 2010 See supra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text. 2011 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e). See also 17 CFR 229.1500(a) and (m) (defining “ carbon offsets ” and “renewable energy credits or certificates”). cost, as applicable, related to “offset emissions (purchase of energy credits)” as one example of the disclosures that may be required2012 and the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RE Cs is a type of transition activity that does not present the definitional or scoping concerns presented by transition activities more generally . In addition, carbon offsets and RECs that are expensed or capitalized are discrete transactions that are curr ently captured in a registrant’s income statement or balance sheet.2013 Moreover, requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs will complement the disclosures regarding carbon offsets and RECs required by the amendments to Regulation S -K that we are adopting in this release . 2014 Furthermore , although the final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks in the financial statements , the final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrants to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances as described in greater detail above,2015 which should result in the disclosure of some of the information for expenditures related to transition activities that we would have expected to be disclosed under the proposed rules , albeit outside of the financial statements. Requiring the disclosure of these expenditures outside of the financial statements and subject to materiality rather than a bright- line threshold, among other things, should mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns raised by commenters with respect 2012 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2013 There is currently a diversity in practice in accounting for carbon offsets and RECs. See infra note 2110. 2014 See supra note 2023. 2015 See supra s ections II.D.2.c (transition plan disclo sure) and II.G.3.a (targets and goals disclosure). to the proposed requirement to disclose transition expenditures in the financial statements .2016 While we are adopting the requirements to disclose expenditures related to transition activities outside the financial statements , we remind registrants that current accounting standards may require the disclosure of material expenditures within the financial statements ,2017 which may include material expenditures incurred in furtherance of a registrant’s transition activities , depending upon the application of these current accounting standards . Current accounting standards specify minimum presentation and disclosure requirements. Importantly, however, the FASB’s Conceptual Framework provides additional guidance for evaluating whether financial information is representationally faithful. In particular, the Conceptual Framework states “[t]o be a perfectly faithful representation, ” a depiction “would be complete, n eutral and free from error. ” The Conceptual Framework further states, “[a] complete depiction includes all information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon being depicted, including all necessary descriptions and explanations”2018 (emphasis add ed). Accordingly, additional disaggregation and disclosure of material expenditures, whether on the face of the primary financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements, may be needed to meet the 2016 See supra section II.D.2.c. for additional discussion of how these revisions mit igate the compliance burdens . 2017 See, e.g. , ASC 230 Statement of Cash flows (requir ing classification of cash receipts and cash payments as resulting from operating, investing, and financing activities ); ASC 280 Segments (noting that a registrant “shall disclose both of the following about each reportable segment if the specified amounts ar e included in the determination of segment assets reviewed by the chief operating decision maker or are otherwise regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, even if not included in the determination of segment assets …(b) total expenditures for additions to long -lived assets…” ) (ASC 280-10-50-25); and ASC 730 Research and Development ( requir ing disclosure of the total research and development costs charged to expense in each period for which an income statement is presented) (ASC 730 -10-50-1). 2018 See FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 – Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 3, Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information (As Amended) (Aug . 2018) , para. QC12 – QC13. objective of the financial reporting as exp lained by the Conceptual Framework .2019 For example, a registrant may consider whether disaggregating material cash outflows to acquire property, plant, and equipment2020 purchased to meet the registrant’s transition plans, targets, or goals on the statement of cash flows or in a related note is appropriate to provide complete information about the entity’s cash flows for the period. Under the final rules, registrants are required to disclose the aggregate amount s of (1) carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) carbon offsets and RECs capitalized , and (3) losses incurred on the capitalized carbon offsets and RECs during the fiscal year. 2021 This disclosure requirement is not subject to the one percent disclosure threshold that applies to the disclosure of severe weather events and other natural conditions . Instead, disclosure is required if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve disclosed climate -related targets or goals,2022 which is consistent with the requirement to disclose information about carbon offsets and RECs included in the amendments to Regulation S -K that we are adopting in this release and therefore will hel p limit the burden for registrants and avoid confusion for investors .2023 In addition, registrants are required to disclose the beginning and ending balances of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year.2024 The beginning a nd ending balances are currently existing information in a registrant’s 2019 See FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 – Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 1, The Objective of General Purpose Financial Reporting (As Amended) (Dec . 2021). 2020 ASC 230- 10-45-13. 2021 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e). 2022 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). 2023 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d) (requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding carbon offsets or RECs “if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve climate -related targets or goal s”). See also supra s ection II.G.3.b. 2024 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). balance sheet that will provide investors with information to help them understand the registrant’s activity related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs, further illustr ating how a registrant is using carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a target or goal . Registrants are also required to disclose where on the income statement or balance sheet the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs are presented under the final rules . 2025 One commenter stated that the proposed rules would likely require many smaller issuers to make significant upgrades to their cash outflow tracking infrastructure.2026 The commenter identified upgrades that would be needed to cash outflow tracking infrastructure to capture the costs and investments for each separate risk, transition activity, and weather event. 2027 However, as discussed above, the final rules will not require disclosure of the proposed Financial Impact Metrics or costs and expenditures related to transition activities in the financial statements . Rather, the amendments to Regulation S -X have been narrowed to focus on severe weather events and other natural conditions and carbon offsets and RECs, which will be less burdensome for registrants. Furthermore, the final rules do not require any disclosure of the impacts to the statement of cash flows. We did not include in the final rules the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the impact of any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rule s, includi ng the proposed Expenditure Metrics. 2028 A few commenters sought clarification about the scope of this 2025 See id. 2026 See supra note 1975 and accompanying text. 2027 See id. 2028 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.2. proposed requirement or questioned what disclosure objective it was intended to achieve.2029 Because the final rules we are adopting are more narrowly focu sed on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, we do not think it would be in keeping with this approach to also require a registr ant to disclose the impacts from any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to Item 1502(a). We recognize that a number of commenters expressed support for the Expenditure Metrics as proposed, including some who stated that the proposed requirements would provide investors with important information about “long term investments in asset resiliency” or would help investors understand a registrant’s ability to meet its climate -related targets and goals. 2030 Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision -useful information about registrants ’ capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions , which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants . ii. Disclosure Threshold (Rule 14-02(b)) In the final rules, we are retaining a quantitative di sclosure threshold for capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions . 2031 Providing a bright -line standard for registrants will simplify 2029 See, e.g. , letters from ABA ; Amer. for Fin. Reform, Sunrise Project et al. ; and Deloitte & Touche. See also letter from Travelers (Mar. 10, 2023) (objecting to the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the impact of any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rule). 2030 See supra note s 1966 and 1967 and accompanying text. 2031 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). compliance compared to a more principles -based standard, reduce the risk of underreporting such information, and promote comparability and consistency among a registrant’s filings over time and among different registrants.2032 Accordingly, t he final rules require disclosure of: (1) E xpenditures expensed as incurred and losses if the aggregate amount of such expenditures expensed as incurred and losses equals or exceeds one percent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit for the relevant fiscal year ; and (2) C apitalized costs and charges recognized if the aggregate amount of the absolute value of capitalized costs and charges recogni zed equals or exceeds one percent of the absolute value of stockholders’ equity or deficit, at the end of the relevant fiscal year.2033 Such disclosure is not required, however, if the aggregate amount of expenditure s expensed and losses as incurred in the i ncome statement is less than $100,000 for the relevant fiscal year .2034 With respect to the balance sheet, registrants are not required to provide disclosure if the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges is less than $500,000 for the relevant fis cal year.2035 In a shift from the proposal, we are using different denominators for the disclosure thresholds. Specifically, the denominators we are adopting are: (1) income or loss before income tax expense or benefit , and (2) stockholders ’ equity or defic it. 2036 Income or loss before income 2032 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.2. 2033 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). 2034 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(1). 2035 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2). 2036 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). tax expense or benefit is a frequently disclosed line item on the income statement that provides an accounting- based measure of financial performance. Stockholders’ equity or deficit is a disclosed line item in the balance sheet that reflects stockholders’ ownership interest in the book value of the registrant and represents the net difference between the assets and liabilities of the registrant. Although we did not receive commenter feedback specifically objecting to the denominators for the proposed Expenditure Metrics (i.e., “total expend iture expensed” or “total capitalized costs”) , we have decided to use these alternative denominators because income or loss before income tax expense or benefit and stockholders’ equity or deficit are well known and understood by registrants and investors and are easily calculable based on line items in the financial statements that are defined under U.S. GAAP and IFRS .2037 These alternative denominators are broadly responsive to commenters who raised concerns that the proposed rules would be inconsistent wi th existing GAAP 2038 or would not result in comparable disclosure,2039 although neither of these concerns was specifically directed at the proposed denominators for the disclosure threshold. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. GAAP includes presentation and disclosure requirements that result in information sufficient to calculate income or loss before income tax expense or benefit , and registrants often do present this amount . In addition, while IFRS does not explicitly require income or lo ss before income tax expense or benefit , the standards do require disclosure of profit or loss and income tax expense . 2038 See supra note 1797 and accompanying text. 2039 See supra note 1793 and accompanying text. controls related to the required disclosure and support the establishment of ICFR and accurate and timely disclosure .2040 In addition, a s mentioned above, income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is a measure of profitability , and requiring a registrant to disclose expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions will help investors understand the impact these events and conditions had on the registrant’s profitability. Likewise, s tockholders ’ equity or deficit represents shareholders ’ interest in the book value of an entity, and requiring a registrant to disclose the capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions will help investors understand the impact these events and conditions have on assets attributable to shareholders. The final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the absolute values of the relevant denominator. 2041 We think it is appropriate to use the absolute values because the balances for these line items may represent debit or credit balances (which are not inherently either positive or negative) in the books and records , and thus using an absolute value will avoid any confusion that could arise from using a negative number resulting from an accounting convention for the disclosure threshold.2042 2040 Some commenters raised concerns that registrants would not be able to calculate the monetary value for the 1% disclosure threshold until the end of the relevant period, which would require registrants to evaluate every transaction to determine if it counts towards the threshold . See su pra note 1814 and accompanying text. Our decision to use income or loss before income tax expense or benefit and shareholders’ equity or deficit a s the denominators in the final rules should mitigate this concern to some extent for registrants because we expect that many registrants will have insight into the magnitude of these denominators prior to the end of the fiscal year . 2041 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). 2042 Other rules in Regulation S -X use absolute values in determining whether a threshold has been exceeded. See 17 CFR 210.1 -02(w) (setting forth the income test for determining whether a subsidiary is a significant subsidiary). In addition, t he final rules require registrants to use the absolute value of capitalized costs and charges recognized for the numerator to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered for the balance sheet disclosures since c apita lized costs and charges can offset one another .2043 Expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement do not offset one another and therefore the use of absolute values is unnecessary to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered. Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics did not use absolute value s in the numerator to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold was triggered,2044 the proposed Financial Impact Metri cs did, and commenter feedback on the use of absolute values in that context was varied . A few commenters supported using the absolute value , and one investor stated that the absolute value would better reflect the significance of the impact on a registrant’s financial perform ance and position.2045 On the other hand, a few commenters objected to using the absolute value and stated it could result in the disclosure of individually immaterial information.2046 We agree with the commenter that stated using the a bsolute value to determine whether the disclosure threshold is triggered will better reflect the significance of the impact on a registrant’s financial position because the absolute value takes into account each of the relevant capitalized costs or charges (i.e., the full magnitude of the costs or charges) , whereas a net amount would not necessarily reflect the total effect on the registrant . 2043 See 17 CFR 210.14 -02(b)(2). 2044 As explained above, the proposed Expenditure Metrics did not require the disclosure of charges, and therefore there was no potential for offsetting, although charges would have been required disclosures under the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. See sup ra note 1732 . 2045 See supra note 1856 and accompanying text. 2046 See supra note 1854 and accompanying text. In a further shift from the propos al, we have included de minimis thresholds in the final rules.2047 As dis cussed above, some commenters expressed the view that the proposed one percent disclosure threshold would place an unreasonable burden on smaller companies because it is more likely that the impacts on smaller companies would exceed the one percent disclos ure threshold.2048 In addition, a few commenter s mentioned a de minimis exception in their letter s.2049 We recognize the possibility that a one percent disclosure threshold could be disproportionately burdensome for smaller companies or companies in the earl y stages of developing a product or business line for which one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit or stockholders’ equity or deficit could be a very small amount . In addition to smaller companies, we think de minimis threshold s will also be helpful for companies that have income or loss before income tax expense or benefit near breakeven in a particular year, perhaps due to anomalous circumstances. Therefore, we have included in the final rules de minimis thresholds of: (1) $100,000 for expenditure s expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, and (2) $500,000 for capitalized costs and charges recognized on the balance sheet . 2050 As a practical matter, this means that, under the final rule s, registrants for which one percent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is less than $100,000 will not have to provide disclosure until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions 2047 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). 2048 See supra note 1823 and accompanying text. 2049 See letter from NAM (“The extreme burden of building new processes and systems to track quantitative climate impac ts, with no materiality threshold or even a de minimis exception for minor events or immaterial impacts, would impose colossal costs and strain resources at all public companies.”). See also letter from Cleveland Cliffs (stating a similar view). 2050 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b). There is precedent in Regulation S -X for using $100,000 as a de minimis threshold. See 17 CFR 210.3- 11 (permitting a registrant to submit unaudited financial statements if gross receipts and expenditures are not in excess of $100,000). equals or exceed s $100,000.2051 Similarly, under the final rule s, registrants for which one percent of the absolute value of stockholders’ equity or deficit is less than $ 500,000 will not have to provide disclos ure until the absolute value of the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions equals or exceed s $500,000.2052 We have decided to use a higher de minimis threshold for c apitalized costs and charge s recognized on the balance sheet because generally the disclosure threshold applicable to the balance sheet —one percent of the absolute value of stockholders’ equity or deficit —will result in larger numbers than the disclosure threshold applicable to the income statement , and therefore a larger de minimis threshold is appropriate and proportionate. Moreover, as noted below in s ection IV , in 2022 the $100,000 de minimis value for the income statement would have exceed ed one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit for approximately 17% of registrants , and the $500,000 de minimis value for the balance sheet would have exceeded one percent of s tockholders’ equity or deficit for approximately 24% of registrants . Thus , approximately the same number of companies will benefit from the de minimis thresholds by using these values. While a number of commenters asserted that requiring disclosure at a one percent threshold would result in an excessive amount of immaterial detail for investors , the changes we 2051 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(1). For example, if a registrant had $5 million in income or loss before income tax expense or benefit for the relevant fiscal year, the registrant’s disclosure threshold for the income statement would be $ 50,000 ($5 ,000,0 00 x .01= $5 0,000). Since $50,000 falls below the $100,000 de minimis threshold, the registrant would not be required to provide the disclosure required by Rule 14- 02(b)(1) and (c) until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses equals or exceeds $100,000 (i.e., the de minimis threshold) . 2052 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2). For example, if a registrant had $2 5 million in stockholders’ equity or deficit for the relevant fiscal year, the registrant’s disclosure threshold for the balance sheet would be $ 250,000 ($25,000,000 x .01=$ 250,000). S ince $ 250,000 falls below the $500,000 de minimis threshold, the registrant would not be required to provide the disclosure required by Rule 14- 02(b)(2) and (d) until the aggregate amount of c apitalized costs and charges equals or exceeds $500,000 (i.e., the de minimis threshold) . have made from the proposal address this concern.2053 Specifically, t he final rules require disclosure of specific categories of discrete capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses , which in our view is unlikely to result in immaterial disclosure . As discussed in greater detail below, the final rules also include an attribution principle that limits the required disclos ure to circumstances where the severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant contributing factor in incurring the capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss.2054 The final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules —stockholders’ equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit — are aggregated amounts and therefore we expect that in many instances they will result in a larger denominator than what was included in the proposal. Given the narrower scope of the final rules, th e one percent threshold should not result in an excessive amount of detail or immaterial disclosure . Some commenters also raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures relative to the impacts of other risks disclosed in the financial statement s or could suggest a level of precision that does not exist.2055 However, the final rules require disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and l osses that are currently recorded in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP , and therefore the disclosures should have the same degree of precision as the other information provided in the financial statements. Moreover, the required disclosures will be in a note to the financial statements along with other 2053 See supra note 1809 and accompanying text. 2054 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(g) and infra Section II.K.3.c.iii. 2055 See supra notes 1810 and 1811 and accompanying text . disaggregated disclosures addressing a variety of topics, and therefore its placement will be on equal footing with other information included in such notes. Other commenters stated that applying the one percent disclosure threshold on a line -item basis could result in only partial disclosure of expenditures related to a climate -related event since the impact could be recorded in multiple financial statement line items —for which the disclosure threshold may not be triggered—which would diminish the usefulness of the information to investors.2056 Our decision not to adopt the proposed Financial Impact Metrics should alleviate this concern to a great extent . However, it remain s true that , under the final rules , the application of the disclosure threshold separately to (i) capitalized costs and charges in the balance sheet , and (ii) expenditures expensed and losses in the income statement could result in a situation where the threshold for only one of the financial statements is triggered and certain costs related to a particular severe weather event or other natural condition may not be required to be disclosed. We acknowledge that in some circumstances this may result in inves tors only receiving a partial picture of the financial statement effects of a particular event or condition ; however, applying the disclosure threshold separately to the income statement and the balance sheet will be more straightforward for registrants to implement and therefore will help to limit the overall burden of the final rules . Moreover, registrant s are not prohibited from disclosing how the severe weather event or other natural condition affected both the income statement and balance sheet, even if the disclosure threshold for one of the financial statements is not triggered. One commenter suggested that a registrant could “game” the rules by classifying costs as expenditures, rather than capitalizing costs , to avoid triggering the disclosure thr eshold. 2057 We 2056 See supra note 1813. 2057 See supra note 1991. think the likelihood of this occurring is low because registrants are required to follow GAAP in determining whether to expense a cost or capitalize it and these amounts will be subject to audit . Certain commenters argued that the Commissio n should apply a different percentage threshold, such as five or ten percent.2058 Although we considered those options, in light of the other changes we are making to the disclosure threshold, such as using a n aggregated denominator and including a de minimis threshold, we think one percent will generally not result in immaterial disc losure nor result in undue burdens on registrants. In this regard, w e agree with those commenters who stated that the appropriate percentage threshold depends upon what is used as the denominator. 2059 For the same reason, we considered, but are not adopting, the other alternative disclosure thresholds that commenters suggested, such as only using a dollar threshold or requiring the disclosure of all relevant expenditures.2060 Certain commenters stated that the examples provided in the Proposing Release of oth er one percent disclosure thresholds were not analogous .2061 Generally, these commenters suggested that the examples were not analogous , at least in part, because they involved amounts that are knowable under current accounting practice and have discrete im pacts on a smaller number of larger line items (as opposed to every line item).2062 Although the alignment with 2058 See supra note s 1837 and 1838 and accompanying text . 2059 See supra note 1839 and accompanying text . 2060 See supra notes 1846 and 1848 and accompanying text. 2061 See supra note 1817. 2062 See, e.g. , letters from BHP (“Further, while we acknowledge that the Commission currently uses a specific 1% threshold for certain disclosures, we note that the disclosure examples provided by the Commission are generally narrow in scope, factual in nature and limited to certain line items in the financial statements (for example, the amount of excise taxes included in revenue)”); Ernst & Young LLP (“But we note that, unlike the climate -related impacts, excise taxes are discrete event charges that are easily calculated and tracked in a registrant’s accounting books and records.”); and IADC (“The Commission argues that a 1% quantitative threshold is used in other contexts, but the examples the Commission cites are circumstances where the quantitative amounts involved are knowable under current accounting practice, have discrete impacts on specific financial line items, and address scenarios in which more detailed disclosure is appropriate. ”). other disclosure thresholds is not dispositive of whether a threshold elicits appropriate disclosure for investors, t he final rules ’ focus on requiring the disclosure of amounts that are currently recorded in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that pertain to a significantly smaller number of line items (as well as the revisions made to the denominators for the disclosure thresholds) should align the final rules more closely with other instances where the Commission has used a one percent or other numerical disclosure threshold. 2063 We have considered the feedback we received from commenters urging the Commission to forgo the one percent disclosure threshold and instead require disclosure only if material.2064 We agree that the concept of materiality plays an important role in the F ederal securities laws . As such, as discussed above, we have significantl y modified the scope of the proposed disclosures and the proposed disclosure threshold and have included de minimis exceptions to focus the final requirements on eliciting material information for investors. We are not, however, eliminating the threshold entirely and moving to a more principles -based disclosure standard because, as discussed in the Proposing Release,2065 the proposed quantitative disclosure threshold provide s registrants with greater clarity in implementing the rules , reduces the risk of underreporting, and increases consistency and comparability . This approach is consistent with the feedback we received from some commenters that expressed concern s about the risks of underreporting in the context of the financial statements , as evidenced by the limited climate - 2063 As noted in the Proposing Release, Regulation S -X (and other aspects of the F ederal securities laws ) includ es a variety of different percentage thresholds prescribing disaggregated disclosure –rather than relying only on principles -based materiality thresholds . See, e.g., 17 CFR 210.5- 03.1(a) (stating that if the total sales and revenues reported under this caption includes excise taxes in an amount equal to 1% or more of such total, the amount of such excise taxes shall be shown on the face of the statement parenthetically or otherwise); 17 CFR 210.5- 02.8 (requiring registrants to state separately, in the balance sheet or a note thereto, any amounts in excess of 5% of total current assets). 2064 See supra note 1827 and accompanying text. 2065 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.2. related disclosure under current accounting standards despite increasing demand by investors for such disclosure .2066 We agree with, and further emphasize, the point made by those commenters who asserted that registrants are already required to disclose the financial statement effect of material climate risks under existing rules.2067 Registrants currently have an obligation to consider material impacts on the financial statements, and the fact that a material impact may be driven by climate - related matters does not alter a registrant ’s obligation.2068 The Commission and accounting standard -setting bodies and their staff have all reminded registrants , through the issuance of guidance , of existing accounting and disclosure requirements that may apply to climate -related matters when there is a material impact on the financial statements.2069 Although the final rules require registrants to disclose certain expenditures if they exceed the one percent di sclosure 2066 See supra note 1833. But see , e.g., letter from M. Winden (suggesting increased enforcement to the extent underreporting exists). 2067 See supra note 1716 and accompanying text. See also letter from CFA Institute (“We would also observe that existing U .S. GAAP and IFRS standards —as highlighted in publications by the FASB and IASB, as noted by the SEC in the Proposal —require consideration of climate -related risks in the measurement of various financial statement estimates.”). 2068 For example, although U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards do not refer explicitly to climate - related matters, registrants have an obligation to consider material impacts when applying, for example, FASB ASC Topic 330 Inventory (IAS 2 Inventories ) and FASB ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment (IAS 36 Impairment of Assets ). See also supra note 2069. 2069 See, e.g. , 2010 Guidance (stating that “registrants must also consider any financial statement implications of climate change issues in accordance with applicable accounting standards, including [FASB ASC] Topic 450, Contingencies, and [FASB ASC] Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties.”); FASB Staff Educational Paper, Intersection of Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters with Financial Accounting Standards (Mar. 2021), available at https://www.fasb.org/Page/ShowPdf?path=FASB_Staff_ESG_Educational_Paper_FINAL.pdf (“When applying the financial accounting standards, an entity must consider the effects of certain material ESG matters, similar to how an entity considers other changes in business and operating environment that have a materi al direct or indirect effect on the financial statements and notes thereto.”); IFRS, Effects of climate- related matters on financial statements (Nov. 2020 and July 2023), available at https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/supporting -implementation/documents/effects -of-climate -related - matters -on-financial- statements.pdf (stating that the IFRS has re -published “this educational material to remind stake holders of the long- standing requirements in IFRS Accounting Standards to report on the effects of climate- related matters in the financial statements when those effects are material.”) . threshold, that requirement does not affect registrants ’ ongoing responsibility to consider material impacts , whether climate -related or not, when preparing their financial statements and related disclosures.2070 This may include determining whethe r costs and expenditures that do not trigger the disclosure threshold may be material to the registrant, taking into consideration all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.2071 iii. Attribution Principle (Rule 14-02(g)) A number of commenters raised co ncerns about the ability of registrants to isolate, attribute, and quantify expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions. 2072 In response to these concerns, we are adopting a principle for attributing a cost, expenditure, charg e, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event or other natural condition and for determining the amount to be disclosed. The final rules ( Rule 14-02(g)) require a registrant to attribute a cost, expenditure, charge , loss, or recovery to a severe weather event or other natural condition and disclose the entire amount of the expenditure or recovery when the event or condition is a significant contributing factor in incurring the cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or recovery. 2073 Some commenters suggested that registrants should be permitted to make a reasonable estimate and disclose the assumptions that resulted in the estimate, or suggested that the 2070 See id. Notwithstanding the final rules’ 1% disclosure threshol d, registrants have a fundamental obligation not to make materially misleading statements or omissions in their disclosures and may need to provide such additional information as is necessary to keep their disclosures from being misleading. See 17 CFR 230.408 and 17 CFR 240.12b- 20. 2071 See Concept Release (discussing materiality in the context of, among other matters, restating financial statements). See also Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (Aug. 12, 1999), available at https://www.sec.gov/interps/account/sab99.htm (emphasizing that a registrant or an auditor may not substitute a percentage threshold for a materiality determination that is required by applicabl e accounting principles). 2072 See supra notes 1902 and 1907 and accompanying text . 2073 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(g). Commission did not need to prescribe a particular approach to attribution or quantification because registrants already have experience allocating costs across risks when preparing financial statements. 2074 Although we considered those possibilities, we are adopting “significant contributing factor” as the attribution principle for the final rule s, which was recommended by a commenter.2075 We think it is appropriate to do so for a number of reasons. First, it is important to establish an attribution principle because allowing a registrant to apply an entity -specific methodology may not result in consistent or comparable information from one registrant to another which would limit the useful ness of the disclosures to investors. Second, the “significant contributing factor” principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor resulting in the registrant incurring the expenditure or re ceiving the recovery, while not requiring disclosure where a severe weather event or other natural condition w as only a minor factor , thereby reducing the cost burden on registrants . Moreover, many areas of U.S. GAAP currently require a registrant to apply the concept of significance (even though U.S. GAAP does not define the term “significant”) , 2076 which should help facilitate registrants’ use of this attribution principle. Although the application of this attribution principle may require the exercise of judgment, financial statement preparers are accustomed to applying judgment in many circumstan ces under U.S. GAAP , and , as stated above, preparers have experience applying the 2074 See supra notes 1913 and 1921 and accompanying text. 2075 See supra note 1918 and accompanying text. 2076 See, e.g., FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting, FASB ASC 323 Equity Method and Joint Ventures , FASB ASC 810 Consolidations , and FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement . concept of significance .2077 Finally, i n addition to enhancing consistency and comparability of how the disclosures are developed , specifying an attribution and quantification principle in the final rules will reduce the burden associated with attributing (since there is no allocation involved) and quantifying costs and expenditures. iv. Recoveries (Rule 14-02(f)) In addition, the final rules ( Rule 14-02(f)) provide that, if a regi strant is required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges , or losses incurred as a result of severe weather event s and other natural conditions , then it must separately disclose the aggregate amount of any recoveries recognized during the fiscal year as a result of the severe weather events and other natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , or losses have been disclosed. 2078 Registrants would have been required to disclose the financial impact s of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including the receipt of insurance proceeds , as part of the Financial Impact Metrics included in the proposed rules. Although we are not adopting the proposed Financial Impact Metrics, along the lines of the proposal, t he final rules provide that any recoveries should be disclosed as part of the contextual information required by the rule s. 2079 Several commenters raised concerns about the treatment of mitigation 2077 To illustrate the application of the attribution principle, if a tornado damages the roof of a registrant’s factory and the registrant incurs costs to repair the damage, the tornado would be a significant contributing factor in incurring the costs to repair the roof and the registrant would be required to disclose the entire cost incurred (if the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered), notwithstanding the fact that if the roof had been in place for some period of time there could be other factors that contributed to the roof’s condition after the tornado. 2078 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). We expect most recoveries to consist of insurance proceeds ; however, we appreciate th at other transactions or agreements may result in recovery of amounts as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as guarantees or indemnifications, and therefore have not limited the disclosure to only insurance proceeds. 2079 See id. See infra s ection II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose contextual information. efforts, such as insurance, unde r the proposed rule s.2080 Relatedly, other commenters asserted that registrants should not be permitted to use “net” amounts to determine whether disclosure is required under the rule s.2081 Having considered those comments, we are persuaded that permitting a registrant to use a net amount to determine whether capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses have exceeded the disclosure threshold would be inconsistent with the intent of the rule s because the net amount could obscure the magnitude of the financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions experienced by the registrant. For example, o btaining insurance is a risk mitigation activity that may ultimately result in payment to the registrant for costs and expenditures incurred, but it does not mean that the financial effects did not occur in the first place. T he existence of recoveries, such as insurance proceeds , is important information for investors because without it , investors could be under the misperception tha t severe weather events and other natural conditions have a greater effect on a registrant’s operations than is the case. Therefore, requiring registrants to disclose whether they have recognized any recoveries, such as insurance proceeds, as a result of the severe weather events and natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , or losses have been disclosed, will provide investors with information that is important to understand the financial statement effects of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and los ses. 2082 In addition, such disclosure w ill complement other contextual 2080 See supra note 1858 and accompanying text. 2081 See supra note 1861 and accompanying text. 2082 One commenter appeared to suggest that it would be contrary to accounting principles to require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures that are not net of insurance proceeds. See letter from Prologis. However, the final rules do not prescribe how a registrant must account for insurance proceeds in its financial statements, and registrants should prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the final rules require a registrant to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed by a registrant such as a discussion of the composition of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges , or losses .2083 Similar to the final rules’ other disclosure requirements, a registrant will be required to identify where the recoveries are presented in the income statement and the b alance sheet.2084 v. Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of “severe weather events and other natural conditions.” 2085 Some commenters pointed out that the proposed amendments to Regulation S -K used the phrase “extreme weather events,” and that the examples of extreme weather events provided in the Proposing Release were different, but overlapping, with the examples of severe weather events included in the proposed amendments to Regulation S -X. 2086 In response to these comments and to provide greater clarity , the final amendments to Regulation S -K and Regulation financial statements and require a registrant to d isclose separately whether it has recognized any recoveries, such as insurance proceeds, as part of the contextual information that must be provided to help investors understand the financial statement effect. 2083 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). 2084 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). Under the final rules it is possible that the disclosure threshold could be triggered for a registrant’s balance sheet, but not its income statement, and vice versa, resulting in only partial disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions incurred during the fiscal year . See supra section II.K.3.c.ii. The final rules require a registrant to disclose the aggregate amount of any recoveri es recognized during the fiscal year as a result of the severe weather events and other natural conditions for which capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , or losses have been disclosed . See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(f). We acknowledge that in some ci rcumstances this may result in a registrant only disclosing a portion of its expenditures corresponding to the event or condition that resulted in the recovery, which could create the impression that a registrant’s recoveries for a particular fiscal year exceed its expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions. However, as explained above, to the extent this is a concern for an issuer, there is nothing in the final rules that would prevent a registrant from disclosing how the severe weather event or other natural condition affected both the income statement and balance sheet, even if the disclosure threshold for one of the financial statements is not triggered. See supra s ection II.K.3.c.ii. 2085 See supra note 1865 and accompanying text . 2086 See supra note 1866 and accompanying text. S-X both use the phrase “severe weather events .”2087 In addition, both include the same examples ; specifically, in a change from the proposal, the examples of severe weather events included in t he final amendments to Regulation S -X include hurricanes and tornadoe s.2088 These revisions are consistent with our expectation that there will be significant overlap between the severe weather events and other natural conditions a registrant identifies for purposes of disclosure under Rule 14 -02 and the types of physical risks (i.e., acute risks (including severe weather events) and chronic risks) a registrant identifies for purposes of disclosure under the amendments to Regulation S -K. However , in response to questions raised by commenters,2089 we are clarifying that a registrant is not required to make a determination that a severe weather event or other natural condition was, in fact, caused by climate change in order to trigger the disclosure required by Rule 14-02 related to such event or condition. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining “physical risks” to include “acute risks” (including severe weather events) and “chronic risks”); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). Although we do not believe there was any confusion about thi s issue, for the avoidance of doubt, we are confirming that “severe” modifies both the weather events and other natural conditions. See 17 CFR 210. 14-02(c), (d), and (h). 2088 See 17 CFR 229.1500; and 17 CFR 210.14 -02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as examples of “chronic risks .” These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to Regulation S -K. See 17 CFR 229.1500. As noted above, the final amendments to Regulation S -X include hurricanes and tornadoes as examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions, in addition to the following examples that were included in the proposed amendments to Regulation S -X and remain unchanged in the final rules : flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise. We have retained the “extreme temperatures” terminology in the final amendments to Regulation S -X instead of using the “sustained higher temperatures” terminology included in the final amendments to Regulation S -K because we want to emphasize that disclosure under Rule 14- 02 is only required if the weather event or other natural condition is “severe.” 2089 See supra note 1873 and accompanying text. Regulation S -X, and it is not required by Rule 14- 02.2090 In this way, although there is significant overlap between the disclosure of climate -related physical risks pursuant to Regulation S -K and the severe weather events and other natural conditions that a registrant identifies pursuant to Rule 14- 02, the events covered by Rule 14- 02 would also cover severe weather events and other natural conditions that are not necessarily related to climate.2091 Since Rule 14 -02 requires event -based disclosure , the decision not to require a registrant to determine whether a severe weather event or other natural condition was caused by climate change should simplify the analysis that a registrant has to undertake to determine whether disclosure is required. We expect that the final rules will elicit disclosure appropriately a ligned with the corresponding risk- based Regulation S -K disclosure without presenting the financial - statement specific challenges associated with making a determination about whether particular events relat e to climate or climate change. The list of examp les of severe weather events and other natural conditions included in Rule 14- 02 is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive , nor are the examples intended to create a presumption about whether disclosure is required for those events in every circumstanc e. 2092 Rather, u nder the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to determine what constitutes a 2090 Similarly, a few commenter s raised concerns about determining the cause of a wildfire, see supra note 1886 and accompanying text , but as we have stated, registrants will not be required to determine the cause of the severe weather event or natural condition for purposes of providing disclosure under Rule 14- 02. The cause of a severe weather event or natural condition is irrelevant in determining whether disclosure is required under Rules 14- 01 and 14- 02. 2091 For example , the “natural conditions ” referenced in Rule 14- 02 need not be climate -related, and therefo re may include types of non- climate -related occurrences, such as earthquakes, if severe and depending on the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances. See letter from Chamber. In addition to simplifying the analysis for registrants, as discussed below, disclosure of these non- climate -related severe weather events and other natural conditions is consistent with the other event -based disclosure reflected in the final amendments to Regulation S -X and will elicit material information for investors. 2092 We believe providing examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions will aid in the comparability of the resulting disclosure while assisting issuers in making the disclosures. See Proposing Release, section II. F.2. severe weather event or other natural condition based on the particular risks faced by the registrant, taking into consideration the registrant’s geographic location, historical experience, 2093 and the financial impact of the event on the registrant, among other factors. We do not agree with those commenters who suggested that we should provide a comprehensive list of severe weather even ts, or refer to a list from another source, because doing so would be inconsistent with the dynamic nature of these events. 2094 Furthermore, a particular weather event may be “severe” in one region but not in another region. We considered whether the non- exclusive list of examples should be expanded to include other types of severe weather events or other natural conditions identified by commenters in their comment letters;2095 however, we designed the list as non- exhaustive and non -exclusive because we thin k it is more appropriate to take a flexible approach to enable registrants to exercise judgment in identifying severe weather events or other natural conditions based on the impacts those events have on their financial condition . Some commenters asserted that allowing registrants to exercise judgment about which severe weather events or natural conditions to analyze would reduce comparability.2096 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant to every 2093 For exa mple, in determining whether high temperatures constitute a severe natural condition, a relevant factor may include average seasonal temperatures. 2094 See supra notes 1867 and 1870 and accompanying text. 2095 See, e.g. , letters from Anthesis (cyclones, water stress, severe participation, and severe wind); Chamber (earthquakes); Climate Advisers (deforestation); and WSP (water stress). 2096 See supra note 1872 and accompanying text. registrant now and in future years . Additionally, r equiring registrants to use a prescribed list of events could lead to significant gaps in disclosure over time. We expect that the final rules w ill give registrants the flexibility to adopt reasonable approaches to identifying severe weather events and other natural conditions and adapt to changing circumstances. As a result, the final rules provide a level of fl exibility that even a regularly updated, prescribed list of events would be unable to match —resulting in what we believe is appropriate, decision- useful information to investors. Some commenters raised questions about how to identify the beginning and ending dates of severe weather events and how to disclose weather events where the impact from the weather event may continue into the future. 2097 We have streamlined the final rules to focus on requiring the disclosure of expenditures for specific transactions that are recorded in a regist rant’s books and records during the fiscal year , and that are attributable to severe weather events or other natural conditions. T his more straightforward approach will make it clearer when disclosure is required and avoid many of the questions raised by commenters in this regard . vi. Carbon Offsets and Renewable Energy Credits (Rule 14-02(e)) If carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s pla n to achieve its disclosed climate -related targets or goals, the final rules ( Rule 14-02(e)) require registrants to disclose (1) the aggregate amount of carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) the aggregate amount of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs recognized , and (3) the aggregate amount of losses 2098 incurred on the capitalized carbon offsets and RECs, during the fiscal 2097 See supra notes 1881 and 1882 and accompanying text . 2098 For example, an impairment could result in the recognition of a loss on a capitalized carbon offset . year.2099 As explained above, although the final rules do not include a requirement for registrants to disclose costs and expenditures related to transition activities in the financial statement s as proposed,2100 we think it is appropriate to require registrants to disclose costs , expenditures , and losses related to one type of transition activity —the acquisition2101 and use of carbon offsets and RECs —because the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and REC s do not present the definitional or scoping concerns raised by commenters with respect to transition activities generally. 2102 Significantly, requiring disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expense d, and losses recognized in the notes to the financial statements when carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve its disclosed climate -related targets or goals will complement the disclosures required by the amendments to Regulation S -K 2103 and will anchor the disclosures required outside the financial statements to those required within the financial statements, making a connection which one commenter generally described as having “ a focusing e ffect” and increas ing “ the reliability and consistency of both.” 2104 Although we considered applying the one percent disclosure thresholds applicable 2099 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). The final rules do not pre vent r egistrants from disclosing additional information about other transactions involving their carbon offsets and RECs. 2100 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. Proposed Rule 14- 02(f), which would have require d the disclosure of expenditures related to transition activities, provided that a registrant may be required to disclose the amount of expense or capitalized cost, as applicable related to “offset emissions (purchase of energy credits),” among other things. See supra note 2012. 2101 Carbon offsets and RECs may be acquired in various ways . For example, they may be purchased or granted . 2102 See supra note 1891 and accompanying text. 2103 See 17 CFR 229.1504(d). 2104 See supra note 1718 and accompanying text. This commenter was referring generally to the Commission’s proposal to amend both Regulation S -K and Regulation S -X when it stated its support for anchoring disclosure s required outside the financial statements to disclosures required inside the financial statements and was not directly addressing the requirement to disclose expenditure related to carbon offsets or RECs . See id. However, this commenter’s general asser tion is equally applicable to the requirements in the final rules to disclose certain information about carbon offsets and RECs inside and outside the financial statements. to severe weather events and other natural conditions to carbon offsets and RECs, using the same trigger fo r disclosure in the amendments to Regulation S -K and the amendments to Regulation S - X will provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the registrant’s use of carbon offsets and RECs, which will help investors evaluate the role of these instrum ents in a registrant’s climate -related strategy and help them assess the likely financial effects of a disclosed material transition risk.2105 In addition, the final rules require registrants to disclose the beginning and ending balances of capitalized car bon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year .2106 The beginning and ending balances of carbon offsets and RECs are an important data point for investors to understand as they assess a registrant ’s transition risks. Specifically, while the disclosure of expenditures related to the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs will provide information about the registrant’s activity throughout the fiscal period, it does not provide information about the carbon offsets still available to the registrant for use in future periods , which some commenters indicated is important information. 2107 The requirement to provide the beginning and ending balances will help provide a more complete picture of the financial impact of a r egistrant ’s use of carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed target or goal. While this particular data point was not part of the 2105 See letter from J. McClellan (stating that a registrant’s intent to meet its climate -related targets or goals through any purchase of offsets or RECs “is directly connected to climate related financial metrics” and “[t]here is consensus that significant capital expenditures will be required to meet the most ambitious targets, a nd investors will want to understand how a registrant is deploying capital against its target .”). 2106 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). 2107 See, e.g., letters from Rockefeller Asset Mgmt. (“It would be helpful to understand a company’s intended utilization of carbon offsets and the corresponding quantification of carbon credits that may need to be purchased.”) ; and Carbon Direct (“Accurate and separate disclosure of … the procurement and retirement of carbon offset credits to attempt to co mpensate for these emis sions, are critical for informed investment decisions.”). proposal, which would have r equired disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition activities more generally, the beginning and ending balances are currently existing information in a registrant’s balance sheet and therefore we expect the cost and burdens of disclosing this information to be minimal. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose where on the balance sheet and income statement these capitalized costs , expenditures expense d, and losses are presented .2108 If a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs , the final rules provide that a registrant must also state, as part of the contextual information required, the registrant’s accounting policy for carbon offsets and RECs.2109 We understand there is currently a diversity in practice in how registrants account for carbon offsets and RECs, and therefore an explanation of the registrant’s accounting policy will help enhance the usefulness and comparability of this disclosure for inves tors. 2110 vii. Presen tation of Disclosure (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) As discussed above, the final rules ( Rule 14-02(c) and (d)) require disclosure of the amount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet , and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe 2108 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). 2109 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(2). See infra s ection II.K.6.a.iii for further discussion of the requirement to disclose contextual information. 2110 On Dec . 15, 2021, the FASB Chair added a research project to explore accounting for regulatory credits (such as carbon offsets and RECs among others). Respondents provided feedback on this project indicating that the lack of guidance in GAAP for accounting for r egulatory credits results in a significant diversity in practice. In May 2022, the FASB added a project to its technical agenda on regulatory credits (such as carbon offsets and RECs among others). See 2021 FASB Agenda Consultation Report, available at https://fasb.org/Page/ShowPdf?path=2021%20FASB%20Agenda%20Consultation%20Report.pdf . In addition, in July 2022, the IASB added a pollutant pricing mechanisms project to their reserve list as a result of its Third Agenda Consultation. The project aim s to develop specific requirements for pollutant pricing mechanisms. See Third Agenda Consultation Feedback Statement, available at https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/third -agenda -consultation/th irdagenda -feedbackstatement - july2022.pdf . weather events and other natural conditions .2111 Under the final rules, registrants must separately aggregate the (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet , and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered and for purposes of disclosure.2112 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses must be seg regated between the balance sheet and the income statement depending on which financial statement the y are recorded within upon recognition in accordance with applicable GAAP. For each of the balance sheet and income statement disclosures , if the applicab le disclosure threshold is met, a registrant is required to disclose the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses and the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred during the fiscal year and separately identify where on the income statement and balance sheet these amounts are presented as illustrated in greater detail below. 2113 With respect to capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs, registrants must disclose these amounts if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a regi strant’s plan to achieve its disclosed climate -related targets or goals. 2114 Unlike the disclosures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, a registrant is not required to separately determine whether the disclosure threshold is triggered for costs , expenditures , and losses that are recorded on the balance sheet versus the income 2111 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c) and (d). 2112 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b), (c), and (d). Similarly, the proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required a registrant to separately aggregate the amount of expenditures expensed and the amount of capitalized costs to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold was triggered. See Prop osing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2113 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c) and (d). 2114 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(e)(1). stateme nt for disclosures related to carbon offsets and RECs .2115 If disclosure is required because carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve its disclosed climate -related targets or goals , then a registrant mu st separately disclose the following: (1) the aggregate amount of each of the capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs during the fiscal year; (2) the beginning and ending balances of capitalized carbon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year ; and (3) where on the balance sheet and the income statement the capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs are presented , as illustrated in greater detail below.2116 We are providing the following example to help illustrate the operation of the final rules. Assume a registrant (1) capitalized $1,200,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event A; (2) incurred an impairment charge of $750,000 in the income statement to write -off $750,000 of inventory from the balance sheet related to Natural Condition B; (3) capitalized $1,000,000 of expenditures to replace the inventory written off related to Natural Condition B; ( 4) expensed $2,000,000 of expendit ures related to Severe Weather Event C; and ( 5) received $400,000 in insurance recoveries related to Severe Weather Event A. The registrant determined that Severe Weather Events A and C and Natural Condition B were significant contributing factors in incurring the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and recovery describe d above. In addition, the registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate -related target or goal , and it capitalized $1,000,000 and expensed $3,000,000 of carbon offsets or RECs during the period. T he registrant had a 2115 See id. 2116 See id. beginning balance of capitalized carbon offsets or RECs of $2,500,000 and ended the year with $500,000 in capitalized carbon offsets or RECs remaining on its balance sheet. The registrant would determine whether the financial statement effects as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the thresholds, as illustrated below: Expenditure Category Current Fiscal Year Balances (Stockholders’ Equity from Balance Sheet, Income or Loss Before Income Tax Expense or Benefit from Income Statement) Severe Weather Event A Natural Condition B Severe Weather Event C Percentage Impact Balance Sheet (capitalized costs and charges) $150,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,750,000 1.97% Income Statement (expenditures expensed as incurred and losses) $75,000,000 $750,000 $2,000,000 3.67% In the above example, the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event A was $1,200,000 (capitalized on balance sheet), the capitalized cost, charge, and loss incurred as a result of Natural Condition B was $1,750,000 (charge on balance sheet and loss in income statement of $750,00 and capitalized cost of $1,000,000 on the balance sheet), and the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event C was $2,000,000 (expense in the income statement). The aggregate amount of the absolute value of capitalized costs an d charges on the balance sheet ($ 2,950,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of stockholders’ equity, and therefore disclosure would be required for these costs and charges. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit , and therefore disclosure would be required for the expenses and loss. In addition, the registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a mater ial component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate -related target or goal, and therefore disclosure would be required for the carbon offsets and RECs. The registrant’s resulting disclosure of such costs and expenditures may be provided, for example, as illustrated in the following table (excluding disclosure of contextual information): Note X . Financial statement effects related to severe weather events and other natural conditions and carbon offsets and renewable energy credits: Category Balance Sheet Income Statement Year Ended Dec . 31, Year Ended Dec . 31, 20X2 20X3 20X1 20X2 20X3 Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions Capitalized Costs and Charges: Inventory $ - $ 250,000a PP&E $ - $1,200,000 Expenditures Expensed as Incurred and Losses: General & Administrative $ - insurance recoveries recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of Severe Weather Ev ent A, including identification of where it is presented in the income statement or balance sheet. In this example, the required contextual information would include the registrant’s accounting policy for the carbon offsets and RECs.2118 Currently , expenditures, costs, charges, losses, and recoveries may appear in different places within the financial statements (e.g., in one or more asset line items or expense line items on the balance sheet or income statement, respectively). The final rules address this disp ersed presentation by requiring registrants to first identify the relevant expenditures, costs, charges, losses, and recoveries and then separately disclose where on the balance sheet and income statement these costs and expenditures are presented . 2119 Such an approach should provide insight into, and context for understanding, the nature of a registrant’s business, and provide consistency and comparability for users of the financial statements. 2118 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a) and (e)(2 ). 2119 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c), (d), (e)(1), and (f). Carbon Offsets and RECs Carbon Offsets and RECs at Jan . 1, 20X3 $2,500,000 Capitalized Carbon Offsets and RECs $1,000,000 Expensed C arbon Offsets and RECs $(3,000,000 ) Carbon Offsets and RECs at Dec . 31, 20X3 $500,000 Carbon offsets and RECs are presented in the Intangible Assets line item on the balance sheet and expensed in the General and A dministrative line item on the income statement.a a. As noted above, there is diversity in practice in accounting for carbon offsets and RECs . See supra note 2110 and accompanying text. In this example, the entity capitalizes all of its costs of carbon offsets and RECs and presents these amounts within the intangible assets line item . We are providin g this example for illustrative purposes only and this is not meant to indicate a preferred method of accounting or presentation. Registrants should consider their specific facts and circumstances when determining the a ppropriate accounting treatment and disclose their accounting policy in accordance with 17 CFR 210.14 -02(e)(2). Similar to the examples of disclosure that were included in the proposed rules, t he final rules state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of expenditure s expensed and losses as incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions , for example, to restore operations, relocate assets or operations affected by the event or condition, retire affected assets, repair affected assets, recognize impairment loss of affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2120 The final rules also state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions , for example, to restore operations, retire affected assets, replace or repair affected assets, recognize an impairment charge for affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2121 4. Financial Estimates and Assumptions (Rule 14-02(h)) a. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and 2120 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c). In response to a question raised by a commenter, with respect to the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions , we are clarifying that the final rules do not require a registrant to disclose both the capitalization of expenditures and subsequent expense of expenditures in the same period. See supra note 1989. Rather, the final rules require the disclosure of expenditures expensed and losses “ as incurred. ” See 17 CFR 210.14 -02(c). For example, a registrant that purchased new machinery to replace machinery that was damaged due to a severe weather event would be required to disclose the cost to purchase the new machinery (assuming the relevant disclosure threshold is met), but the registrant would not be required to disclose (or include in the numerator for purposes of calculating the disclosure threshold) the subsequent depreciation associated with the machinery. 2121 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(d). in the proposed rules wo uld create an affirmative obligation for a foreign private issuer to provide interim updates for any material changes beyond what they would already be required to disclose on Form 6- K.2164 c. Final Rule s We are adopting the proposed requirements ( Rule 14-02(h)) for registrants to disclose impacts on financial estimates and assumptions with some modifications.2165 First, the Commission proposed to require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the consolida ted financial statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a potential transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate related targets disclosed by the registrant. 2166 The final rules, instead of requiring disclosures related to “a potential transition to a lower carbon economy,” require registrants to disclose financial estimates and assumptions related to a narrower category of transition activities, specifically, “any . . . transition plans disclosed by t he registrant.”2167 As noted above, commenters, including registrants, raised concerns about the scope of transition activities and potential difficulties with identifying and quantifying their impacts when they overlapped with a registrant’s ordinary business decisions. 2168 To reduce the potential burden on registrants, we have decided to narrow the scope of transition activities covered by this aspect of the final rule to only those transition plans disclosed by the registrant. 2169 Consistent with the 2164 See letter from BHP . 2165 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h) . 2166 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. 2167 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). 2168 See supra note 1892 and accompanying text. 2169 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). propos ed rules, the final rules also require a registrant to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from , any climate- related targets disclosed by the registrant.2170 Second, consistent with commenters’ suggestion,2171 we are modifying the proposed requirements by adding a materiality qualifier in the final rules. The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from , severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. 2174 2170 See id. 2171 See supra notes 2138 -2141 and accompanying text. 2172 We have added hurricanes and tornadoes to the list of severe weather events and other natural conditions included in Rule 14- 02(h) to be consistent with the addition of these two types of severe weather events or natural conditions in Rule 14 -02(c) and (d). See supra section II.K.3.c.v. 2173 See 17 CFR 2 10.14- 02(h). As previously discussed, the final rules include similar requirements under subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K to disclose material impacts on financial estimates and assumpt ions as a direct result of disclosed actions under a transition plan or as a direct result of a disclosed target or goal or actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal . See 17 CFR 229.1502(e) , discussed supra section II.D .2, and 17 CFR 229.1504(c )(2), discussed supra section II .G.3. When responding to these Regulation S -K provisions, a registrant may cross -reference from the disclosure provided under 17 CFR 210 .14-02(h) to the extent such disclosure is responsive to the se subpart 1500 provisions. 2174 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). For the avoidance of doubt, if the registrant’s estimates and assumptions were not materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions , or any climate- relate d targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant, then no disclosure is required under Rule 14- 02(h). As described above, a number of commenters indicated that if we adopted a requirement to disclose impacts on estimates and assumptions , then it would be appropriate to include a materiality qualifier in the final rule s, and those commenters recommended various permutations related to the materiality qualifier.2175 After considering this feedback, w e have modified the final rules to focus on estimates and assumptions that have been materially impacted because a registrant may use num erous inputs and assumptions, including qualitative considerations, when developing accounting estimates. F ocusing on estimates and assumptions that were materially impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets and plans w ill help to reduce operational challenges and burdens that could arise if registrants were required to assess all impacts when determining the disclosures that would be required. We considered whether it would be appropriate to in stead include two materiality qualifiers and r equire the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions that were materially impacted. However, we think that adding a second materiality qualifier is unnecessary because the disclosures that would result from the two different alternatives would like ly be the same. Namely, w e think it is unlikely that there could be “material ” impact to an estimate or assumption if the estimate or assumption itself was not material to the financial statements .2176 We also consider ed whether to require disclosure of any impacts to material estimates and assumptions or to not include any materiality qualifiers in the final rules, but we think the approach we are taking appropriately balances investors’ need for decision- useful informat ion with a desire to reduce operational challenges for registrants. 2175 See supra notes 2138 -2141 and accompanying text. 2176 See supra note 381 and accompanying text. We continue to believe that disclosure of whether and how climate- related events impacted the development of financial estimates and assumptions w ill provide important information to investors. As the Commission stated in the Proposing Release, such disclosure will provide insight into the impacts described above on the registrant’s financial statements and will allow investors to assess the reasonableness of the registrant’s estimates and assumptions . 2177 Among other things, these disclosures will allow investors to evaluate material impacts on future cash flows, which will help investors make more informed investing decisions. We also agree with those commenters that stated disclosure o f impacts on financial estimates and assumptions would enable investors to evaluate a registrant’s “physical risk resilience,” 2178 or would inform investors “of the scope, likelihood, and magnitude of potential risks as perceived by the company” and enable “ comparative analysis against peers.” 2179 Some commenters stated that they did not support the proposed requirement to disclose financial estimates and assumptions because existing accounting standards already require the disclosure of this information and therefore this additional requirement would be unnecessary or could be confusing for investors. 2180 Although we agree with commenters that U.S. GAAP and IFRS require the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions in many circumstances,2181 including significant inputs associated with material estimates and assumptions, the final rules will enhance transparency and consistency by requiring registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed 2177 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. 2178 See letter from Morningstar. 2179 See letter from BMO Global. 2180 See supra notes 2145 and 2146 and accompanying text. 2181 See supra note 2145. targets and transition plans, which may require more specific disclosures in certain situations than is currently required under applicable accounting standards. In addition, although we agree with commenters that the proposed requirements share similarities with critical accounting estimates,2182 we do not think those disclosures obviate the need for this requirement because the final rules go further by requiring specific disclosure about how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. W hile critical accounting estimates are often presented outside of the financial statements, the disclosure regarding material impacts to estimates and assumptions will be located in a single note to the financial statements along with the other financial statement disclosures we are adopting, which will enhance the usefulness of the disclosure to investors . Furthermore, w e do not think the requir ed disclosure will be confusing to investors . To the contrary, it will provide investors with more decision -useful information about the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements than is required under applicable accounting standa rds. Registrants are presumably making business decisions and taking actions to achieve their disclosed transition plans and targets and t hese decisions may have material impact s on their estimates and assumptions . Providing investors with an understandi ng of these impacts will help them better evaluate a registrant ’s financial position , performance , and future cash flows . Other commenters raised concerns about registrants’ abilities to isolate the relevant impacts when there may be more than one contributing factor. 2183 We expect these concerns to be mitigated to some extent by the final 2182 See supra notes 2153 and 2154 and accompanying text. 2183 See supra note 2150 and accompanying text. rules, which include a materiality q ualifier and thereby focus management on a narrower category of impacts for which management should have greater insight . In addition, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of the impacts , which general ly is less burdens ome to produce than if management had to identify a specific amount. In addition, we are reiterating a few examples that were included in the Proposing Release where severe weather events, natural conditions, or a registrant’s disclosed targets or transition plans could affect a registrant’s financial estimates and assumptions.2184 For example, a registrant’s climate -related targets and related commitments, such as a disclosed commitment to achieve net -zero emissions by 2040, may impact certain accounting e stimates and assumptions. Also, for example, if a registrant disclosed a commitment that would require decommissioning an asset by a target year, then the registrant’s useful life and salvage value estimates used to compute depreciation expense as well as its measurement of asset retirement obligation should reflect alignment with that commitment. Financial statement estimates and assumptions that may require disclosure pursuant to the final rules may include those related to the estimated salvage value o f certain assets, estimated useful life of certain assets, projected financial information used in impairment calculations, estimated loss contingencies, estimated reserves (such as environmental reserves , asset retirement obligations, or loan loss allowances), estimated credit risks, fair value measurement of certain assets, and commodity price assumptions. Finally, a lthough we considered whether it would be appropriate to require disclosure of material changes in estimates, assumptions, or methodology a mong fiscal years and the reasons 2184 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. for those changes ,2185 at this time we are not including such a requirement in the final rules. T he narrower scope of the final rules, which is focused on discrete transactions that are currently recognized in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP, reduces the need for explicit requirements regarding material changes in estimates and assumptions underlying the financial disclosures . Current requirements under GAAP would continue to apply to material changes in estimates and assumptions. 2186 In addition, in response to the commenter that asked for clarification about whether foreign private issuers would have to provide interim updates,2187 we are clarifying that the final rules will not af fect existing filing obligations under Form 6 -K. 5. Opportunities a. Proposed Rule s The proposed rule s would have permitted a registrant , at its option, to disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate -related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K, on any of the financial statement metrics.2188 The Proposing Release explained that if a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the impact of a climate -related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so consistently ( e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the 2185 See supra note 2157 and accompanying text. 2186 See FASB ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections and IFRS IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 2187 See supra note 2164 and accompanying text. 2188 See Proposing Release, s ections II.F.2, 3, and 4. opportunities and triggering the threshold.2212 One commenter requested that the Commission provide additional guidance around the definition of climate -related opportunities.2213 c. Final Rule s In light of the changes to other aspects of the final rules , we have decided not to adopt the proposed rules related to the disclosure of opportunities. First, a s discussed above, we have decided not to adopt: (1) the proposed Financial Impact M etrics,2214 (2) the proposed requirement to disclose costs and expenditures related to general transition activities in the financial statements (e.g., a portion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics) , and (3) the proposed requirement to disclose the impacts of any climate -related risks identified pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K. The proposed rules would have permitted a registrant to disclose the impact of any opportunities with respect to each of these disclosure items .2215 Because the se disclosure items will not be included in the final rules, there is no reason to adopt final r equirements regardin g the disclosure of opportunities with respect to these items . Second, as discussed above in section K.3.c , in a modification from the proposed rules, the final rules require the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges , and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events.2216 Unlike the proposed rules, t he final rules do not make a distinction between “risks” and “opportunities” in the financial statement disclosure requirements. Therefore, we do not think it is necessar y to retain a provision related 2212 See letter from Morningstar. 2213 See letter from PwC . 2214 See supra note 1735 for an explanation regarding the overlap between the proposed Financial I mpact Metrics and the proposed E xpenditure Metrics. 2215 See Proposing Release, s ections II.F.2, 3, and 4. 2216 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c) and (d). The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of costs and expenditures to “mitigate the risks from seve re weather events and other natural conditions.” See Proposing Release, section II.F.3. to the disclosure of opportunities. To the extent that a registrant incurs costs and expenditures as a result of a severe weather event (applying the final rules’ attribution principle), the registrant would be required to disclose these costs and expenditures under the final rules regardless of the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met). However, we do not expect that registrants will commonly incur costs , expenditures , charges, and losses as a result of severe weather event s or other natural conditions in furtherance of an opportunity. In this regard, our expectation is consistent with the Proposing Release, which did not provide any examples of opportunities associated with severe weather e vents and other natural conditions in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics . 2217 To the extent that a registrant identifies a cost or expenditure incurred as a result of severe weather event s or other natural conditions that it believes was in curred in furtherance of an opportunity, disclosure of the cost or expenditure would be required (assuming the other requirements of the final rules are satisfied ) as explained above. However , the registrant would not be required to identify any costs or expenditures disclosed under Article 14 as related to an “opportunity” as explained in greater detail below.2218 The same analysis applies to opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. The requirement in the final rules to d isclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed 2217 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3 (stating , in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics, that a registrant may choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities but remaining silent with respect to opportunities for costs and expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions). 2218 The same analysis applies to opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. The requirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Under the final rules, a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs , expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs regardless of the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met) for the same reasons as discussed in this paragraph with respect to severe weather events . See 17 CFR 210.14 -02(e). rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Under the final rules, a registrant is required to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RE Cs regardless of the reason for the expenditure (assuming the disclosure threshold is met) for the same reasons as discussed in the previous paragraph with respect to severe weather events . We expect that registrants will most commonly incur costs, expenditures, and losses in connection with the acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs as part of a strategy to mitigate transition risk as opposed to in furtherance of an opportunity . However, to the extent that a registrant incurs such costs, expendit ures, and losses in furtherance of an opportunity, the registrant would not be required to identify any amounts disclosed under the final rules as related to an “opportunity” as explained in greater detail below. Third, as discussed above in s ection K.4, we are adopting Rule 14- 02(h), which we have modified from the proposal, to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions the registrant used to produce the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to r isks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. 2219 After further consideration, we believe that including a pr ovision regarding the disclosure of the impact of opportunities on the financial estimates and assumptions is also unnecessary. That is because Rule 14 -02(h) requires a registrant to disclose the “known impacts” on its financial estimates and assumptions and “impacts” is not limited to 2219 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). negative impacts.2220 Nor does “known impacts” draw a distinction between the impact s resulting from “risks” or “opportunities.” In other words, to the extent that a registrant’s financial estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events or other natural conditions or disclosed targets or transition plans, the r egistrant would be required to disclose this material impact under the final rules regardless of the reason for the impact.2221 Therefore , we are not adopting the proposed rules related to the voluntary disclosure in the financial statements of the impact o f any opportunities related to financial estimates and assumptions . The approach we are taking in the final rules will mitigate many of the concerns that commenters raised about the disclosure of opportunities , while still providing investors with decisi on-useful information about a registrant’s capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and material impacts to estimates and assumptions . As discussed above, the final rules do not distinguish between “risks ” and “opportunities ” in requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and material impacts to estimates and assumptions, and registrants will not be required to identify any amounts disclosed under the final rules as related to a “risk” or “opport unity.” Furthermore, any capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, losses, and material impacts to financial estimates and assumptions required to be disclosed under the final rules are limited to those that a registrant has actually incurred and recorded in its books and records . These aspects of the final rules should alleviate commenters’ concerns about the potential for greenwashing, 2222 issues regarding 2220 See id. 2221 See id. 2222 See supra note 2197 and accompanying text. auditability,2223 and concerns that registr ants could be required to disclose sensitive or competitive business information related to opportunities .2224 Similarly, commenters’ concerns about the definition of “opportunities” as applied to the financial statement disclosures2225 are rendered moot because , as explained above, the final rules will not require registrants to identify particular capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, losses, or material impacts to estimates and assumptions as derived from an opportunity, and furthermore the fin al rules no longer include a definition of opportunities .2226 6. Financial Statement Disclosure Requirements a. Contextual Information (Rule 14-02(a)) and Basis of Calculation (Rule 14- 01(c)) i. Proposed Rule s In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that because the proposed financial statement metrics would involve estimation uncertainties driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other financial statement disclosures, registrants would be required to disclose conte xtual information to enable a reader to understand how it derived the financial statement metrics, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the metrics. 2227 2223 See supra note 2202 and accompanying text. 2224 See supra n ote 2193 and accompanying text. 2225 See supra note 2208 and accompanying text. 2226 See supra section II.C.1.c. 2227 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that inputs and assumptions may include the estimation methodology used to disaggregate the amount of impact on the financial statements between the climate- related events and activities an d other factors. The Proposing Release also stated that policy decisions may include a registrant’s election to disclose the impacts from climate -related opportunities. See Proposing Release, section II.F.1. financial statements, one commenter sta ted that the proposed rule “makes no allowance for wholly- owned subsidiaries, which may lead to duplication and double counting.”2244 In addition, most commenters supported requiring the application of existing GAAP to the proposed financial statement metr ics.2245 However, a number of commenters raised concerns that certain of the proposed financial statement metrics would not necessarily comport with GAAP, including amounts for lost revenues, cost savings , or cost reductions.2246 In addition, in response to a question in the Proposing Release, certain commenters stated that the proposed financial statement metrics should be calculated at a reportable segment level when a registrant has more than one reportable segment, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting, or presented by geographic areas that are consistent with the registrant’s reporting pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 280- 10-50-41. 2247 On the other hand, some commenters stated that they did not support calculating and presenting the disclosures at a segment or geographic level because it would be too complex or would result in the disclosure of irrelevant information. 2248 iii. Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, we are adopting the requirement ( Rule 14-02(a)) to provide contextual information with certain clarifying modifications. We have decided to include in the text of the final rules two additional types of contextual information a registrant is required to disclose. 2249 In addition to the types of contextual information included in the 2244 See letter from PPL. 2245 See, e.g., letters from Chamber; E ni Spa; KPMG; and Mazars. 2246 See letter from Chamber. See also, e.g., letters from KPMG; PwC; SIFMA; and Soc. Corp. Gov. 2247 See, e.g., letters from Eni Spa; ICGN; Mazars; Moody’s; Morningstar; and Sarasin. 2248 See, e.g., letters from Abrasca; BHP; and SEC Professionals. 2249 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). proposed rule s, registrants will also be required to disclose significant judgments made and other information that is important to an investor’s understanding of the financial statement effect .2250 Therefore, under the final rul es, a registrant must “[p]rovide contextual information, describing how each specified financial statement effect . . . was derived, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, significant judgments made, [and] other information that is important to understand the financial statement effect and, if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the specified disclosures .”2251 Similar to the Proposing Release, in the discussion of the financial statement disclosures above , we provide d certain non- exclusive examples of the types of contextual information that registrants may be required to disclose depending on the particular f acts and circumstances. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects .2252 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting may involve estimation uncertaintie s that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, like certain other financial statement disclosures,2253 and therefore disclosure of contextual information will facilitate investors’ understanding of the financial statement effects and will be an integral part of the financial statements. 2250 See id. 2251 See id. 2252 See supra note 2232 and accompanying text. 2253 For example, the application of FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC Topic 326 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses require the application of judgment when applying GAAP to the financial statements. FASB ASC 275 -10-50-6 through 50 -15A require the disclosure of information about certain significant estimates. In addition, FASB ASC 235 -10-05-3, 05-4, and 50 -1 require the disclosure of information about accounting policies. In response to certain commenters’ requests for clarification or additional guidance,2254 as noted above, we decided to include in the final rules two additional types of contextual information that will en hance investors’ understanding of the financial statement disclosures . We have decided to include “significant judgments” as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures , and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures .2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions. 2256 In addition, to enhance understanding of the financial statement disclosures , the final rules explicitly require disclosure of other information that is important to understand the financial statement effects .2257 In section II. K.3.c.iv above , we have specified one instance where the final rules require registrants to disclose this type of contextual information because we think t he information is important to understand the financial statement effects of the 2254 See supra note 2239 and accompanying text. 2255 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). Registrants are regularly required to exercise judgment when applying GAAP to prepare their financial statements and therefor e the fact that the final rules will require registrants to exercise judgment is not unusual . For example, FASB ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires an entity to disclose significant judgments in the application of the guidance (AS C 606- 10-50-17), FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to disclose judgments and assumptions about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements, and FASB ASC Topic 842 Leases requires a lessees to disclos e information about significant assumptions and judgments made in applying the requirements of Topic 842 . 2256 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(a). 2257 See id. disclosed capitalized costs, expenditure s expen sed, charges, or losses .2258 By requiring the disclosure of information that is important to understand the financial statement effects , the requirement to provide contextual information will also help registrants avoid having incomplete and potentially mis leading disclosures. We disagree with the commenters who stated that requiring disclosure of contextual information would result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is not useful for investors.2259 On the contrary, the requirement to provide contextual information will improve the comparability of disclosures by enabling investors to understand how registrants have exercised judgment and made assumptions in determining the financial statement effect . This will enable investors to compare judgments and assumptions made by registrants, including across industries, which w ill provide investors with useful information for purposes of their investment and voting decisions. Furthermore, although we are clarifying aspects of the contextual informat ion requirement, we disagree with the commenters who stated that the requirement to provide contextual information should be simplified and that more guidance is needed with respect to the level of detail required. 2260 The final rule s intentionally provide flexibility to registrants to allow them to include contextual information that is tailored to their particular circumstances thereby improving the usefulness for investors of the disclosures. One commenter stated that a registrant would be required to ma ke many assumptions and policy decisions to disclose contextual information. 2261 As noted above, the final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed , charges, and losses incurred 2258 See id. 2259 See supra note 2236 and accompanying text. 2260 See supra notes 2237 and 2238 and accompanying text. 2261 See supra note 2236 and accompanying text. as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which require fewer assumptions and policy decisions by the registrant than would have been required under the proposed rules. As a result, we expect the extent of contextual information provided under t he final rules will be reduced as compared to the proposal. We are also adopting the requirements ( Rule 14-01(c)) for registrants to calculate the financial statement effects using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the r egistrant’s consolidated financial statements and to apply the same set of accounting principles that a registrant is required to apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements, consistent with the proposal. 2262 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, requiring registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosures using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements w ill avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency, and aid comparability. 2263 In addition, we agree with the commenter who stated that applying the same set of accounting principles to the financial statement disclosures will aid comparability.2264 We are not aware of any cir cumstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP, and therefore we are striking the words “[w]henever applicable” from the final rules, in response to the commenter who stated that this phrase was confusing because it could i mply that 2262 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(c). 2263 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.1. As noted above, one commenter stated that the proposed rule “makes no allowance for wholly- owned subsidiaries, which may lead to duplication and double counting.” See supra note 2244 and accompanying text. Although the comment letter doe s not provide additional context for this statement, we think the commenter may have the misimpression that the proposed disclosure threshold would have been evaluated at the parent and subsidiary level separately. On the contrary, and as proposed, the fi nal rules will require registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosure using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of its consolidated financial statements included in the filing, which we do not believe would result in any double -counting or duplication. 2264 See supra note 2241 and accompanying text. the Commission is aware of circumstances where the applicable accounting principles would be inconsistent with GAAP.2265 In addition, it is important for investors to be provided with information that is consistent across financial statements. As discussed above, the Commission also received feedback about whether registrants should be required to calculate the proposed financial statement metrics at a reportable segment level or to present the metrics by geographic areas. 2266 The Commission did not propose such requirements and —although we do not necessarily agree with those commenters that stated requiring disclosure at a segment or geographic level would be too complex or result in the disclosure of irrelevant information2267—we think the approach to disclosure we are adopting strikes an appropriate balance between providing consistent, comparable, and decision- useful information to investors and the associated burdens to registrants. Finally, several areas of commenter question or concern related to the requirements discussed above are addressed by our decision to not adopt the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and to focus on the disaggregation and disclosure of discrete transactions that are recorded in the financial statements. For example, concerns about the interaction between GAAP and the proposed Financial Impact Metrics w ill not apply to the final rules. 2268 For the sake of clarity, however, we reiterate that the rules the Commi ssion is adopting require registrants to apply existing GAAP recognition and measurement requirements to the financial statement disclosures . 2265 See supra note 2242 and accompanying text. 2266 See sup ra notes 2247 and 2248 and accompanying text. 2267 See supra note 2248 and accompanying text. 2268 See supra note 2246 and accompanying text. liability in light of the estimates, judgments, and assumptions that would be required to disclose the proposed financial statement metrics .2354 c. Final Rule s As explained above, we believe it is appropriate to require that the financial statement effects disclosure we are adopting be presented in a note to the financial statements (Rule 14- 01(a)).2355 Identifying a specific location for the disclosures – a note to the financial state ments – will make the information more accessible for investors.2356 In addition, we agree with the commenter that stated that including the disclosure of the financial statement effects in the financial statements will facilitate invest or decision- making. 2357 As is true of any disclosures included in the financial statements, s ubjecting the required disclosures to a financial statement audit and registrants’ ICFR will enhance the reliability of that information. The scope of the final rules is significantly narrower than the proposal and requires the disclosure of costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants’ books and records and material ly impacted financial estimates and assumptions. T hese modifications will ease ma ny of the burdens that registrants identified with respect to requiring the disclosures to be subject to audit and ICFR. We considered the various alternatives suggested by commenters, including whether to require the disclosure of financial stateme nt effects to be provided in supplemental information 2354 See, e.g., letters from BOA ; LTSE ; NAM ; Soc. Corp. Gov. ; and TotalEnergies . 2355 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(a). 2356 See, e.g. , letters from PGIM; and UAW Retiree. See also IAC Recommendation ( indicating its support for requiring the presentation of disclosures in the financial statements and stating “[m]aking this information available in a predictable way that is consistent with the location of other important data helps achieve the goal of consistent dissemination of this important information”). 2357 See letter from Sarasin. or a schedule outside of the financial statements .2358 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting, however, present financial information that is derived from registrants’ books and records and is already included in registrants’ financial statements . Therefore, presenting this information in a note to the financial statements , consistent with other financial statement disclosures, will en hance its accessibility and usefulness for investors. We do not think it would be appropriate to exempt the se financial statement disclosures from audit or ICFR requirements . Providing an exemption from audit or ICFR for the financial statement disclosur e requirements in the final rules could confuse investors about which parts of the financial statements are covered by audit and ICFR. Nevertheless, the phase in periods provided for in the final rules should give registrants and their auditors time to fa miliarize themselves with the new requirements before the compliance date and should help to mitigate the concerns raised by commenters. With respect to auditing standards, PCAOB standards can and will apply to the financial statement disclosures inclu ded in a note to the financial statements. We understand that a number of commenters raised concerns about applying PCAOB standards and stated that additional guidance would be needed.2359 The modifications made to the final rules to narrow their scope to capitalized costs , expenditures expensed , charges , and losses derived from transactions and amounts recorded in registrant’s books and records underlying the financial statements and material ly impacted estimates and assumptions, along with the Commission’ s adoption of an attribution principle, will help to mitigate commenters’ concerns about the auditability of the disclosures. In light of these modifications, we expect that including the 2358 See supra notes 2306 and 2308 and accompanying text. 2359 See, e.g. , supra note 2318 and accompanying text. financial statement note as part of the audited financial statement s will allow the disclosures to be readily incorporated into the scope of the financial statement and ICFR audit s that registrants currently obtain and that existing PCAOB auditing standards will readily apply. Several commenters raised concerns about how auditors would address the one percent disclosure threshold when considering materiality in planning and perfor ming an audit.2360 Auditors should apply the concepts of materiality in PCAOB AS 2105, Con sideration of Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit, to the rules we are adopting. In applying the concept of materiality, auditors should remain alert for misstatements that could be material due to quantitative or qualitative factors and lesser amounts of misstatement could influence the judgment of a reasonable investor because of qualitative factors. 2361 Under PCAOB Auditing Standards, auditors should also evaluate whether, in light of particular circumstances, there are certain accounts or disclosures for which there is a substantial likelihood that misstatements of lesser amounts than the materiality level established for the financial statements as a who le would influence the judgment of a reasonable investor. If so, the Auditing Standards provide that the auditor should establish separate materiality levels for those accounts or disclosures to plan the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures for those accounts or disclosures.2362 Additionally, there are numerous rules in Regulation S -X as well as other disclosure requirements within GAAP that include a percentage disclosure threshold.2363 Based on staff 2360 See supra note 2321 and accompanying text. 2361 See PCAOB AS 2105, paragraph .03. 2362 See id., paragraph .07. 2363 See, e.g. , supra note 2063 and accompanying text; FASB ASC 280- 10-50-12 (requiring the reporting of separate information about an operating segment that meets certain q uantitative thresholds), 280 -10-50-14 (stating that if total of external revenue reported by operating segments constitutes less than 75% of total consolidated revenue, additional operating segments shall be identified as reportable segments (even if they experience, we understand that auditors have developed procedures for auditing such disclosures and have not claimed an inability to audit that information. We expect auditors similarly will be able to apply the concepts of materiality and to audit the financial statement disclosures included in the final rules, particularly given the final rules’ narrower scope . Therefore, there is no need to delay the requirement to obtain an audit or exclude the financial statement disclosures from the scope of the audit or the registrants ’ ICFR . The rules we are adopting will provide the suitable criteria necessary for the disclosures to be subject to audit. Nevertheless, the Commission will work with the PCAOB to address any issues that come to light regarding the auditing of this information and will consider issuing additional guidance to the extent needed and helpful. Finally, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested that consultants or experts outside of the traditional accounting sector should be allowed to audit the proposed financial statement disclosures . 2364 The auditor’s unqualified opinion contains an expression of opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, which refers to a complete set of financial statements, including the related financial statements notes and any related sched ules. 2365 As stated above, we expect that the audit procedures applied to the financial statement note will be do not meet the criteria in paragraph 280 -10-50-12) until at least 75 % of total consolidated revenue is included in reportable segments), 280- 10-50-42 (stating, among other things, that if revenues from transactions with a single external customer amount t o 10% or more of a public entity’s revenues, the public entity shall disclose that fact, the total amount of revenues from each such customer, and the identity of the segment or segments reporting the revenues), and 323 -10-50-3 (requiring, among other things, disclosure of the names of any significant investee entities in which the investor holds 20% or more of the voting stock, but the common stock is not accounted for on the equity method, together with the reasons why the equity method is not considered appropriate, and the names of any significant investee corporations in which the investor holds less than 20% of the voting stock and the common stock is accounted for on the equity method, together with the reasons why the equity method is considered appropriate). 2364 See supra note 2327 and accompanying text. 2365 See PCAOB AS 3101, paragraph .08, The Auditor’s Report on an Audit of the Financial Statements When the Auditor Expresses an Unqualified Opinion . incorporated into the scope of registrants’ current financial statement and internal controls audit and therefore PCAOB -registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient, appropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law.2366 Moreover, PCAOB - registered accounting firms are subject to periodic inspection by the PCAOB and are required to comply with PCAOB rules, including a requirement to establish a system of quality control that is implemented throughout the accounting firm, which will enhance investors’ confidence in the accuracy of registrants’ disclosures. However, this does not mean t hat the auditor cannot use the work of an auditor specialist while performing its work if the auditor determines doing so would be appropriate in accordance with applicable auditing standards. PCAOB AS 2101, paragraph .16, Audit Planning, states that auditors should determine whether specialized skill or knowledge, such as an auditor specialist, is needed to perform the appropriate risk assessments, plan or perform audit procedures, or evaluate audit results. Auditors may use the work of auditors’ special ists to assist in their evaluation of significant account s and disclosures, including accounting estimates. In doing so, auditors consider the requirements within PCAOB AS 1201, Supervision of the Audit Engagement , when using the work of auditor -employed specialists, and AS 1210, Using the Work of an Auditor -Engaged Specialists , when using the work of an auditor engaged specialist, as appropriate. The Commission received mixed feedback about whether it would be clear that : (i) the financial statement dis closure requirements would be included in the scope of the audit when a 2366 See 15 U.S.C. 7212 (“It shall be unlawful for any person that is not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in the preparation or issuance of, any audit report with respect to any issuer, broker, or dealer.”). See also letter from CalPERS (“We expect that the regular auditor will do the audit.”). registrant files financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and (ii) the proposed rules would not alter the basis of presentation of financial stateme nts as referred to in an auditor’s report.2367 Therefore , we are clarifying that the financial statement disclosure requirements we are adopting in this release must be included in the scope of the audit when a registrant files financial statements in accor dance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. We believe that these disclosures are important and should be required regardless of the GAAP followed. Furthermore, r egistrants that file financial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB are subject t o the existing requirement to comply with Regulation S -X, 2368 and we are not aware of any policies that would prevent registrants from including the financial statement disclosures in a note in the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Further, the final rules will not alter t he basis of presentation of financial statements referred to in an auditor’s report. The instructions to Form 20- F make it clear that the issuer’s financial statements must be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. 2369 PCAOB AS 3101.08 states that the first section of the auditor’s report must include a “statement identifying each financial statement and any related schedule(s) that has been audited” and a “statement indicating that the financial statements, including the related notes and any related schedule(s), identified and collectively referred to in the report as the financial statements, were audited.” 2370 2367 See supra notes 2337 -2339 and accompanying text. 2368 See Acceptance from Foreign Private Issuers of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Without Reconcilia tion to U.S. GAAP, Rel. No. 33 -8879 (Dec. 21, 2007) [73 FR 986, 999 n.136 (Jan. 4, 2008)] (stating that “Regulation S –X will continue to apply to the filings of all foreign private issuers, including those who file financial statements prepared using IFRS as issued by the IASB,” but providing that such issuers “will comply with IASB requirements for form and content within the financial statements, rather than with the specific presentation and disclosure provisions in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Regulation S -X”). 2369 See, e.g. , General Instruction E(c)(2) and Instruction 2 to Item 8.A.2 of Form 20 -F. 2370 See PCAOB AS 3101, paragraph .08. As the disclosure requirements we are adopting will be included in a note to the foreign private issuer’s financial statements and based on information that is recognized and measured in the foreign private issuer’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, they will be within the scope of the statement by the registrant’s auditor that the financial statements “including any related notes” were audited. A number of commenters provided feedback on the cost of the audit for the proposed financial statement metrics and some of these commenters suggested that the estimate included in the proposal was too low 2371 or that the proposed financial statement metrics would result in significant fees or an increase the cost of the audit.2372 Given the narrower scope of the final rules and their focus on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants ’ books and records and material impacts to financial estimates and assumptions rather than the proposed Financial Impact Metrics , we expect any increases to the cost of the audit due to the financial statement disclosures will be relatively modest for mos t companies . 2373 In addition, we agree with those commenters that stated the costs of auditing the proposed note to the financial statements would likely decrease or stabilize over time like other areas of audit work. 2374 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting share many similarities with other disclosures in the financial statements, in particular because they are based in transactions currently recorded in registrants’ books and records, and therefore the cost trajectory for auditing should be similar over time. 2371 See supra note 2344 and accompanying text. 2372 See supra notes 2343 and accompanying text. 2373 See infra section IV.C.3.b. v. 2374 See supra notes 2350 -2351 and accompanying text. Finally, a number of commenters argued that the Commission should adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement metrics.2375 Some of these commenters limited their request to forward -looking financial disclosures included in the financial statement s, while other commenters did not appear to limit their request for a safe harbor to forward- looking financial disclosures. By nar rowing the scope of financial statement disclosures and focusing on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants’ books and records and material financial estimates and assumptions, the final rules avoid many of the complexities associated with the proposed rules and therefore we do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures . L. Registrants Subject to the Climate -Related Disclosure Rules and Affected Form s 1. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to apply t he proposed climate -related disclosure rules to a registrant with Exchange Act reporting obligations pursuant to Exchange Act s ection 13(a) 2376 or section 15(d)2377 and companies filing a Securities Act or Exc hange Act registration statement.2378 The Commission propos ed to require such registrant s to include climate -related disclosure s, including the proposed financial statement metrics,2379 in Securities Act or Exchange 2375 See supra notes 2353 and accompanying text. 2376 15 U.S.C. 78m(a). 2377 15 U.S.C. 78o(d). 2378 See Proposing Release, s ection II.J. 2379 See Form 20 -F, General Instruction B(d) (stating that Regulation S -X applies to the presentation of financial information in the form). Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20- F, and the forms that refer to Form 20- F (including Forms F -1 and F -3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements prepared in accor dance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, proposed Article 14 disclosure was nevertheless required (similar to disclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S -X).

              "\"The Commission is adopting final rule s ( Item 1502(a) to require the disclosure of any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant. The final rules are responsive to investors’ need for decision -useful information regarding registran ts’ material climate-related risks. In addition, because a registrant may be able to assess the material risks posed by its value chain, this change will also limit the burdens of climate risk assessment on third parties. The final rules’ definition of “ transition risk s” includes the same non- 323 See, e.g., letter from Chamber. Final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. Some commenters opposed proposed Item 1502 because in their view it would be difficult to distinguish between a climate -related physical risk and an ordinary weather risk. The final rule s include several changes from the proposal that mitigate some of the burdens of Item 1502(a), as it was proposed. The proposal would have called for specific information about physical risks, such as disclosures relating to flooding and the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high water stress. It also includes a non- exclusive list of disclosures the registrant must provide, as applicable, including whether the transition risk relates to regulatory, technological, market, or other transition -related factors. Describing the nature of an identified transition risk in this manner will help i nvestors understand the realized or potential material impacts. “over whatever time period is relevant to a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances ”). Some commenters recommended bifurcating the climate risk disclosures into short -term and long- term timeframes, without a medium -term timeframe, similar to certain MD&A disclosures. One of those commenters stated that imposing a different temporal standard for climate risk disclosure would pose meaningful challenges. A s defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important. The materiality determination is fact specific and one that requires both quantitative and qualitative considerations. The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate -related risks. Commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but recommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the most likely and significant impacts. Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule provision was not necessary because the Commission’s existing rules generally require a registrant to disclose the effects of material effects. The list, which is intended to be non- exclusive, includes, as applicable, material impacts on the registrant’s. If none of the listed types of impacts or any other impacts are material, a registrant need not disclose them. The final rule will help elicit more meaningful and relevant disclosure without overburdening registrants or investors. Corp. Gov. forward -looking disclosures,”438 which should provide registrants with more flexibility to determine the appropriate disclosures needed in response to the requirement. We also have eliminated the requirement to describe how any of the financial statement metrics or GHG emissions metrics relate to the registrant’s business model or business strategy. The final rules refer to the regis trant’s “business, results of operations, and financial condition ” rather than “consolidated financial statements.” This is to reflect that the type of disclosure that is intended by this provision is more similar to that found in MD&A. The final Regulation S-X provisions that we are adopting, on the other hand, do not cover financial impacts caused by transition risks. This Regulation S -K provision, therefore, will elicit disclosure s about material expenditures related to activ ities engaged in for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate -related risks. The Commission proposed to require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate -related risk management strategy to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks. The proposed requirements were int ended to help investors understand how a. registrant intends to address identified climate-related risks and any transition. to a lower carbon economy. Investors have sought more detailed disclosure about transition plans. A registrant’s transition plan may have a significant impact on its overall business strategy. The final rule does not list the types of transition risks and factors related to those risks that must be disclosed. We disagree with commenters who stated that this updating requirement would result in disclosure of information that is not meaningful for investors. We do not expect that it would be particularly burdensome for the company to disclose update d information about actions taken under the plan on a going forward basis. Disclosure of the steps a registrant intends to make under a transition plan, and whether it has taken those steps, will help investors assess the financial impacts of the plan. To avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment, such disclosure is most appropriate. A registrant will not be required to comply with either provision until the fiscal year immediately following the fisca l year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status. 527 See 17 CFR 229.1503, discussed infra section II. F. investors about how a registrant intends to reduce its exposure to a material transition ris k while limiting the burdens on registrants.528 Modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to focus on material exp enditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions will help to mitigate this concern. 529 While the final rules seek neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the adoption of transition plans, we recognize that the compliance burdens of disclosure may influence some registrants’ decisions with respect to risk management practices. Investors have increasingly sought information from registrants about their use of scenario analysis and expressed a need for improved disclosure about such use. The final rule’s scenario analysis disclosure requirement will depend on whether and how a registrant use s such analysis. The rule will not require a ny registrant to conduct scenario analysis. We are, however, adopting modifications in the final rules. We have deleted from the definition the example that “registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies un der certain future climate scenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 °C,. 567 See 17 CFR 229.1502(f). Conversely, if a registrant conducts scenario analysis and determines from its results that it is not likely to be materially impacted by a climate -related risk, no disclosure about its use of scenario analysis is required. The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered “ an increase of no greater than 3 ºC, 2 ¼C, or 1.5 ¹C above pre-industrial levels.” We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. We decline to follow the recommendation of one commenter who stated that disclosure of scenario analysis should only be required when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative. g).g.g. g.g (G.g). G.G. (g.G). g.G (g,g) (g),g.h (g,.g), g.H (g.,g), G.H. (h,g,h), g,g. The final rule will require disclosure only when a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing is material to how it evaluates and manages a climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) We are requir ing disclosure of this information because, as commenters noted, it will help investors understand a registrants’ internal carbon Pricing practice. We also have included a provision, similar to the rule proposal, stating that if the scope of entities and operations involved in the use of a described internal carbon price i s materially different than the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of calculating GHG emissions, the registrant must briefly describe this difference. We are adopting the proposed requirement s to disclose board oversight of climate -related risks. We are also adding Instructio n 1 to Item 1501 to clarify that in the case of a foreign private issuer with a two-tier board of director s, the term “ board of directors ” means the supervisory or non -management board. The final rule s will provide investors with the information they need to understand and evaluate those oversight arrangements. Proposal would require registrants to disclose board committee or subcommittee responsible for oversight of climate -related risks. Final rule will avoid generating detailed disclosure about matters that are not important to investors. Final rules balance investors’ need to understand board’s governance of climate-related risks with concerns that the proposal could inadvertently pressure registrants. The Commission is adopting the proposed requirement to disclose management oversight of climate related risks (Ite m 1501(b) with some modifications. The final rule s will, like the proposed rules, require that registrants describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate -related risks. However, we are limiting the disclosure required by this final rule provision to material climate-related risks, as suggested by commenters. ......... What do you think?

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of photos. We agree with commenters that this information will be helpful to understanding a registrant’s ability to manage climate -related risk s. We emphasize that registrants are required to make this disclosure only if they have identified a material climate risk. The final rule has been modified to eliminate many of the prescriptive disclosure elements from the proposal. The Proposed Rule, if adopted, would present a costly distraction for companies with limited resources (particularly small- cap and many mid- cap companies) to attempt to align their behavior and disclosures with those of other companies. We are adopting a less prescriptive approach that focuses on a description of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks. If a registrant has not identified a material climate -related risk, no disclosure is required. A materiality qualifier addresses the specific concerns expressed by commenters that the proposal would require registrants to disclose this information in a level of detail that would impose undue costs. We have removed several prescriptive elements from the final rule. The final rule will elicit disclosures that offer a more complete picture of the management of material climate-related risks. 780 See supra note 733 and 734 and accompanying text. reduce the prescriptiveness of the risk management disclosure requirement and streamline this requirement, as we have done with other areas of the final rule s. In response to one commenter who supported the proposal but cautioned against an overly broad application,781 we confirm that the final rules do not require registrants to speculate in their disclosures about future restructurings. If a registrant sets an internal target or goal that materially affect s or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition, then investors should have access to information about that target. We decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters that the targets and goals disclosure requirement should only be triggered by the board's or CEO's formal adoption of the target. The final rules do not include “emissions” in the list of information that must be disclosed if necessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of a target or goal. We are not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by the regis trant. Final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal. No update about targets or goals would be required if the underlying target s or goals are not required to be disclosed. 873 This provision will help to eliminate redundancies in the s ubpart 1500 disclosure. 874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. 875 A registrant may elect to provide disclosure regarding these additi onal items, but they are not required items of disclosure. In addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items. The final rules, including those pertaining to the use of offsets or RECs, are neutral regarding any strategy that a registrant may choose to manage a material climate-related risk. Proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions888 for its most recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements. We proposed to define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO 2”); methane (‘CH 4’); nitrous oxide (’N 2O’), nitrogen trifluoride (� ‘NF 3’) and hydrofluorocarbons. Final rules include a Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure requirement, although modified from the rule proposal. LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs will be required to comply with the final rule’s GHG emissions disclosure requirements. The TCFD recently reported that only 30% of North American companies surveyed reported their Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions in 2021. We acknowledge that registrants could incur costs to assess and monitor the materiality of emissions, even in situations in which they determine that they do not need to provide such information. We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. We are further limiting the GHG emissions disclosure requirement to LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs and on a phased in basis. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources. Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure. The final rules do not require an AF to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level. The benefits that assurance will provide in terms of investor protection and increased confidence in GHG emissions disclosure warrants requiring attestation. We recognize commenters’ concerns about the potential cost of obtaining assurance, the pote ntial shortage in the current supply of assurance providers, and the continually evolving state of assurance standards and methodologies. Several commenters urged the Commission to adopt the verification process for GHG reporting used by the EPA in lieu of the proposed assurance requirements. The practice of providing assurance over GHG emissions is far from nascent and is now expected by many market participants. We agree with commenters that requiring registrants to disclose whether they obtained voluntary assurance and related details w ould help those investors in companies that voluntarily obtain assurance. The assurance requirements in the final rules are narrowly tailored and limited to a subset of registrants, many of which already obtain assurance services. We disagree with those commenters that suggested we wait before determining whether to adopt a mandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions. The phase in periods included in the 1221 See supra notes 1131 and 1132 and accompanying text. 1234 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500- and-esg-reporting. 1235 See, e.g., letter from INGAA. 1236 See supra note 1217. in the Proposing Release that limited assurance is not possible unless the assurance provider also believes reasonable assurance is possible on the subject matter. We expect that registrants’ ability to hire a non- accounting firm as a GHG emissions attestation provider and our decision to make certain modifications to the proposed requirements should help address concerns. The benefits of obtaining reasonable assurance are apparen t now and we do not expect those to change in the future. A number of commenters recommended that the Commission extend the phase in periods. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10 -Q. The final rules also extend the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emission disclosure to which it applies. The proposed rules would have required the attestation report to be included in the separately captioned “Climate- Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing. However, as discussed above, the final rules leave the placement of climate -related disclosures, other than the financial statement disclosures, largely up to each registrant. Proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHg emissions After the Compliance Date for GHG Emissions Disclosure but before the Compliance date for Assurance. We believe registrants would be better served by such flexibility. We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. We. believe that the requirements we have included in the final rules will help ensure that GHG. emissions attestation providers have sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute the. attestatio n engagement. In addition, non- CPAs are not able to use the AICPA or PCAOB attestation standards. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirement for a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with respect to the registrant and any of its affiliates. We view the independence requirements in the two contexts as providing similar, if not equivalent, protections to investors. The final rules model the factors the Commission will consider in determining whether a GHG emi ssions attestation provider is independent. The phased in compliance period will give registrants adequate time to find a provider that meets the independence requirements. The staff of the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants or GHG emissions attestation providers. The likelihood of this scenario is reduced by the multiyear phase in compliance period we are adopting. The exemption from the GHG emissions reporting and assurance requirements for SRCs and EGCs provides most new ly public companies with time to develop any in- house expertise that may be necessary. It is possible that the application of the independence requirements in the final rule s may result in a GHG emissions attestation provider no longer being able to provide certain non- assurance services to its assurance client. IESBA stated that it “holds to the premise that sustainability assurance engagements... must be underpinned by the same high standards of ethical behavior and independence.” The Commission is amending Rule 436 to provide that a report by a n attestation provider covering Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statement s made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level. We remind registrants and providers that there are other remedies available to shareholders and /or the Commission. Proposed rules would have required the attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be included in the separately- captioned “ Climate -Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing. The Commission explained that the proposed requirement that the standards be established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures. The Commission is adopting the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report requirements with some modifications from the proposal. The final rules provide that the attestation report must be provided pursuant to standards that 1462 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; Futurepast; and Mazars. The propos ed rules also would have required the attested standards to be publicly available at no cost. In addition, it is important to recognize the value that investors have found in the voluntary assurance services currently being provided. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to use assurance standards they are already using for their voluntary disclosures.  ISO standards are widely used for GHG emissions assurance. We do not mean to imply that other standards, either those currently in existence, or those that may develop in the future, would not be suitable for use under the final rules. The Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants about whether a particular standard meets the rules. 1492 Therefore, the benefit of including the proposed minimum requirements would be marginal, at best, and could be viewed as redundant. 1493 We decided against including any additional requirements for the same reason. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be “suitable” Final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505, we agree with the commenters that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia’ The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant’s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal. The decision not to adopt a requirement for a. registrant to disclose whether its GHG. emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will. eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required. Final rules require disclosure of “any” oversight inspection program that applies to the GHG emissions attestation provider. The AICPA’s peer review program and PCAOB”s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs. We considered whether to only require disclosure about the existence of oversight inspections programs from registrants who engage GHG emission attestation providers that are not registered. See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement Inspection Process —Preliminary Evidence, 93Acct. Rev. 53, 53-80 (2018) We are concerned that requiring this disclosure only with respect to certain GHG emission attestation providers could result in confusion. Final rules will require an AF or LAF subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose whether its former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned or was dismissed and the date thereof. If so, the regis trant must state whether during the performance of the attestation engagement there were any disagreements. The final rules also include two instructions defining the term “disagreements” for purposes of the disclosure. The Commission proposed to require a registrant that was not required to include a GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed rules to disclose certain information. The final rules will not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions from any registrant. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures, the Commission is adopting a provision stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) constitute “forward -looking statements” T o the extent that disclosures made in response to these Items or to. any other s ubpart 1500 provision contain one or more of the following statements, they w ill fall. within the PSLRA statutory definition of “forward- looking statement ”. For example, a. projection or estimate of a registrant’s future GHG emissions made pursuant to. Item 1504 would likely constitute a forward-looking statement. The PSLRA safe harbors do not apply to statements made in connection with an IPO, or related to the operations of a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program. The Commission recently amended Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b- 2 to define “blank check company” as a company that has no specific business plan or purpose. See Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and Projections. We have determined that it is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors to extend the safe harbor to these entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies. Extending the PSLRA safe Harbor to these specified disclosures will encourage more comprehensive disclosures under these Items. We are not using our exemptive authority to extend. the safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities. Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s. ection 21E(b). (ii) forward looking -statements contained in. a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company. The final rules’ safe harbor will not be available for forward -looking statements included in a registrant’s consolidated financial statements. The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to provide a safe harbor from private litigation for such disclosures. The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: Financial Impact Metrics, Expenditure Metrics and Financial Estimates and Assumptions. Proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided additional transparency for investors. Proposed Expenditure Metrics referred to the positive and negative impacts associated with severe weather events, other natural condi tions, and climate-related activities. Commission also considered comments with respect to the proposed Expenditures Metrics. Proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions. Proposed Financial Impact Metrics focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s) The number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of income statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the final rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement effects. The proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to “mitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions” effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions have on a registrant’s financial statements. Only those line items that reflect capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses fall within the scope of the disclosures. We do not expect that gross revenues would be impacted under the final rules. Final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks in the financial statements. Final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrant to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances. Instead, disclosure is required if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve disclosed climate -related targets or goals. Registrants are also required to disclose where on the income statement or balance sheet the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs are presented. Reform, Sunrise Project et al. ; and Deloitte & Touche. See also letter from Travelers (Mar. 10, 2023) (objecting to the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the impact of any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rule) The final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the absolute values of the relevant denominator. The balances for these line items may represent debit or credit balances (which are not inherently either positive or negative) in the books and records. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose the capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events. Under the final rule s, registrants for which one percent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is less than $100,000 will not have to provide disclosure until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions. There is precedent in Regulation S -X for using $ 100,000 as a de minimis threshold. Final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules —stockholders’ equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit — are aggregated amounts. Some commenters raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures. 2061 See supra note 1817. 2062 See, e.g., letters from BHP and Ernst & Young LLP. 2063 We have considered the feedback we received from commenters urging the Commission to forgo the one percent disclosure threshold. 2064 We agree that the concept of materiality plays an important role in the F ederal securities laws. U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards do not refer explicitly to climate - related matters, but registrants have an obligation to consider material impacts. The final rules ( Rule 14-02(g) require a registrant to attribute a cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event. Second, the “significant contributing factor” principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor. Third, specifying an attribution and quantification principle in the final rules will reduce the burden associated with attributing and quantifying costs and expenditures. The final rules do not prescribe how a registrant must account for insurance proceeds in its financial statements. The final rules require a registrants to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed. A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of “severe weather events.” Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500. The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as “chronic risks.” These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to regulation S -K. The final rules require registrants to disclose expenditures for specific transactions that are recorded in a registrant’s books and records during the fiscal year. The final rules provide a level of fl exibility that even a regularly updated, prescribed list of events would be unable to match. The acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs do not present the definitional or scoping concerns raised by commenters. Proposed Rule 14- 02(f), which would have require d the disclosure of expenditures related to transition activities. This commenter was referring generally to the Commission’s proposal to amend both Regulation S -K and Regulation S-X. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose where on the balance sheet and income statement these capitalized costs, expenditures expense d, and losses are presented. Final rules require disclosure of the amount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe weather events. In May 2022, the FASB added a project to its technical agenda on regulatory credits (such as carbon offsets and RECs among others) Assume a registrant capitalized $1,200,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event A. The registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate -related target or goal. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, and therefore disclosure would be required. The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events. The final rules require the disclosure of expenditures expensed and losses “ as incurred. transition plans disclosed by t he registrant. 2168 To reduce the potential burden on registrants, we have decided to narrow the scope of transition activities covered by this aspect of the final rule. 2169 Consistent with the 2164 See letter from BHP. 2165 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). 2166 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. Final rules will require registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed targets and transition plans. The final rules will provide investors with more decision-useful information about the estimates and assumption used to prepare the financial statements than is required under accounting standa rds. Final rules focused on discrete transactions that are currently recognized in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Current requirements under GAAP would continue to apply to material changes in estimates and assumptions. Final rules will not af fect existing filing obligations under Form 6 -K. The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed rules related to the disclosure of opportunities. The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of costs and expenditures to “mitigate the risks from seve re weather events and other natural conditions.” We do not expect that registrants will commonly incur costs, expenditures, charges, and losses as a result of severe weather event s or othernatural conditions in furtherance of an opportunity. The Commission is not adopting the proposed rules related to the voluntary disclosure in the financial statements of the impact o f any opportunities related to financial estimates and assumptions. The approach we are taking in the final rules will mitigate many of the concerns that commenters raised about the disclosure of opportunities. The final rules do not distinguish between “risks ” and “opportunities ” Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, we are adopting the requirement ( Rule 14-02(a) to provide contextual information with certain clarifying modifications. We have decided to include in the text of the final rules two additional types of contextual information a registrant is required to disclose. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects. We disagree with the commenters who stated that requiring disclosure of contextual information would result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is not useful for investors. The final rule s intentionally provide flexibility to registrants to allow them to include contextual information. This will enable investors to compare judgments and assumptions made by registrants, including across industries. We are not aware of any cirstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP. The Commission did not propose such requirements and —although we do not necessarily agree with those commenters that stated requiring disclosure at a segment or geographic level would be too complex or result in the disclosure of irrelevant information. We think the approach to disclosure we are adopting strikes an appropriate balance between providing consistent, comparable, and decision- useful information to investors and the associated burdens to registrants. financial statement note as part of the audited financial statement s will allow the disclosures to be readily incorporated into the scope of the financial statement and ICFR audit s that registrants currently obtain. Several commenters raised concerns about how auditors would address the one percent disclosure threshold when considering materiality in planning and perfor ming an audit. incorporated into the scope of registrants’ current financial statement and internal controls audit and therefore PCAOB -registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient, appropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law. 2366 See 15 U.S.C. 7212 (“It shall be unlawful for any person that is not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in, any audit report”). Final rules focus on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants’ books and records and material financial estimates and assumptions. Final rules avoid many of the complexities associated with the proposed rules. We do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures.\""

Furthermore, adopting a climate -related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions (set forth below in Item 1500) and is based on the climate -related disclosure framework of the TCFD, with which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardiz ing climate -related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful information for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already providing some climate -related disclosure based on the TCFD framework.',\n",

The proposed rule provisions pertaining to governance, strategy, and risk management would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to describe any climate -related opportunities it was pursuing when responding to those provisions.354 In this regard, the Commission proposed a definition of “climate -related opportunities” that was similar to the corresponding TCFD opportunity definition provided by the Commission.',\n",

The “reasonably likely” component of the rules we are adopting, as with the same standard in MD&A regarding known trends, events, and uncertainties, is grounded in whether disclosure of the climate -related risk would be material to investors and requires that management evaluate the consequences of the risk as it would any known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty.

For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term “outlook” is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or or forecasts in response to Item 1502(b).',\n",

The requirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs.',\n",

Furthermore, adopting a climate -related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions (set forth below in Item 1500) and is based on the climate -related disclosure framework of the TCFD, with which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardiz ing climate -related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful information for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already providing some climate -related disclosure based on the TCFD framework. 326 As discussed in more detail in section II.K.3.c.v, although Article 14 of Regulation S -X req uires a registrant to disclose certain financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which may include weather events that are not climate- related, subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K does not require the disclosure of material impact s from non -climate -related weather events. T he final rules provide that a registrant that has identified a climate -related risk pursuant to Item 1502 must disclose whether the risk is a physical or transition risk, providing information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presente d and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk.334 The final rules then provide a non- exclusive list of disclosure s that a registrant must disclose as applicable: • If a physical risk, whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk, and the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk;335 and • If a transition risk, whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and in vestor preferences), or other transition - related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.336 333 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. In such instances, the Commission indicated that a registrant should provi de a clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk, as well as how those risks have evolved or are expected to evolve over time.341 The final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature For example, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk, and to provide the accompanying IP code or other subnational postal zone.345 The final rules we are adopting no longer require such disclosure and instead include, as one of the physical risk items that a registrant must disclose, as applicable, the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the identified physical risk.346 This revision is intended to address the concern of many commenters that the proposed ZIP code disclosure requirement would be burdensome to produce and would likely not provide useful information for many investors.350 This revision will give registrant s the flexibility to determine the granularity of any location disclosure s based on their particular facts and circumstances as long as they provide information necessary to understand the extent of water -related risks (the registrant’s exposure to such risks will be disclosed subject to a prescriptive approach ). This change was made in order to conform more closely to the definition of “transition risks” in Item 1500, which refers to “regulatoryity, technological, and market changes.” Although this definition refers to impacts to a registrant’s liability or reputation as non -exclusive examples of negative impacts resulting from such changes, the definition of transition risks also refers to other examples of negative impacts that are not specifically mentioned in Item 1502(a)(2). The proposed rule provisions pertaining to governance, strategy, and risk management would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to describe any climate -related opportunities it was pursuing when responding to those provisions.354 In this regard, the Commission proposed a definition of “climate -related opportunities” that was similar to the corresponding TCFD opportunity definition provided by the Commission. 378 Discussion In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact, a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters.375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long- term (i.e., 371 See, e.g. 438, 449 (1977) to further explain that an omitted fact is material if there is “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of info rmation made available.”). The “reasonably likely” component of the rules we are adopting, as with the same standard in MD&A regarding known trends, events, and uncertainties, is grounded in whether disclosure of the climate -related risk would be material to investors and requires that management evaluate the consequences of the risk as it would any known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Final Rules The final rule provision (Item 1502(b)) will require a registrant to d escribe the actual and potential material impacts of any climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) on the registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook.422 Information about the actual and potential material impacts of climate -related risks on a registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook is central to understanding the extent to which a registrant’s business strategy or business model has changed, is changing, or is expected to change to address those impacts. For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term “outlook” is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or or forecasts in response to Item 1502(b). We have revised one of the types of potential material impacts listed in the proposal that referenced “suppliers and other parties in [ a registrant’s ] value chain, ” by replacing this phrase with “[s]uppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available.” This revision is intended to address the concern of some commenters that requiring a registrant to include material impacts to a registrant’s value chain would be overly burdensome to both the registrant and to entities in the registrant’s value chain. 430 Thus the final rule limits the scope of this specific topic to include only material impacts to the registrant’s suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts and further limits the information that should be disclosed about those impacts to information that is known or is reasonably available.431 The adopted provision is consistent with the Commission’s general rul es regarding the disclosure of information that is difficult to obtain, which will apply to the final rules if their conditions are met.432 Accordingly, as modified, this provision will help limit the compliance burden of the final rules by eliminating any potential need for registrants to undertake unreasonable searches or requests for information from their value chains. Under the final rules, as part of its targets and goals disclosure,441 a registrant will be required to provide disclosure concerning its use of ca rbon offsets or RECs if they constitute a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve its climate -related targets or goals.442 Given this targets and goals disclosure require ment, explicitly requiring disclosure concerning the use of carbon offsets and RECs in the context of Item 1502(c ) is not necessary. We acknowledge the commenter who recommended that we delete the term “business model” in the proposed disclosure item;443 however, w e have retained the use of th is term in the final rule because requiring a registrant to disclose a material impact on its business model caused by a climate -related risk will provide important information to investors about the effectiveness of the registrant’s climate -related risk management that would otherwise be lost were we to omit this reference. This will not only provide investors with important information about a registrant ’s strategic decision -making concerning a material climate -related risk but should also help the registrant determine whether there are material expenditures that must be disclosed, thereby lower ing the compliance burden, as some commenters noted.452 This disclosure requirement is intended to capture actual material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year for the purpose of climate -related risk mitigation or adaptation. As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant’s climate -related goals as part of a registrant’s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. Although similar co ncerns could arise with respect to Item 1502(d) ’s expenditures disclosure requirement, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright -line threshold, as was proposed for th e Regulation S -X amendments, and limiting the disclosure to material expenditures that, in “management’s assessment, ” are the direct result of mitigation or adaptation activities, will help to mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns. In addition, in responding to the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the expenditure and how management has determined that it is a direct result of the disclosed transition activities, which may help alleviate concerns about potential liability exposure for attribution decisions.460 Requiring the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, from management’s assessment, directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will also provide investors with important information that will help them understand a registrant ’s transition strategy. 492 Another commenter stated that, due to the long timeline of transition plans, annual progress updates w ould in many cases not provide meaningful information for investors.493 This comm enter rule recommended that there should instead be a requirement to annually report any actions taken to achieve transition plans that are material to the registrant, as well as any material positive or negative deviations from the plan or changes to it that a re material to the registrant. 494 Another commenter stated that a registrant should have to update its transition plan disclosure only when the registrant believes it is appropriate to do so, and such updating should occur at most on an annual basis.495 c. Final rule After consider ing comments received, we are adopting, with modifications from the proposal, a final rule provision (Item 1502(e)) that will requir e a registrant to describe a transition plan i f it has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk.496 Like the rule proposal, the final rules define (in Item 1500) a “transition plan” to mean a registrant’s strategy 490 See, e.g. transition plan disclosure will have the flexibility to provide disclosure that addresses the particular facts and circumstances of its material transition risk.506 We also note that, as with scenario analysis and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant’s transition plan disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor. 507 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires a registrant to update its annual report disclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing any actions taken during the year under the plan, including how s uch actions have impacted the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. 516508 This updating requirement will help investors understand the registrant’s progress under the plan over time, track the impacts of a transition plan on a registrant’s business and, as noted by commenters, help inform investment decisions. In a modification of the proposed rule, which would have generally required the disclosure of the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage transition risk under a transition plan, the final rule will require a registrant, as part of its updating disclosure, to i nclude quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates a nd assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions taken under the plan.517 While this provision is similar to Item 1502(d), Item 1502(e) differs in that it is intended to elicit disclosure about material expenditures and material impacts on financ ial estimates and assumptions that directly result from actions taken under a transition plan (e.g., material expenditures made for climate- related research and development ). As recommended by one commenter,523 we have removed the reference to physical ris ks that was in the proposed rule.524 This change will make the transition plan disclosure requirement more consistent with disclosure that are based on the TCFD’s recommendation s,525 which may mitigate the costs and complexity of complying with t he final rule for registrants already familiar with the TCFD’s framework.526 A registrant that faces a material physical risk, however, will still be required to disclose how it is managing that risk as part of its risk management disclosure.527 These revisions will elicit material information for 521 We remind registrants that while they are permitted to cross -reference to information in their financial statement s to satisfy t heir Regulation S -K disclosure obligations, they are not permitted to cross -reference to Regulation S -K disclosures in their financial statements, unless otherwise specifically permitted or required by the Commission’s rules or by U.S. underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis disclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board as part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.557 Some commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly available scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), or the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), to enhance the comparability of the scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each registrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its disclosure accordingly.559 c. The disclosure of a registrant’s use of scenario analysis can provide important forward -looking information to help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant’s strategy under various climate -related circumstances.560 Scenario analysis has increasingly been recognized as an important analytical tool in assessing a company’s climate -related risk. would be burdensome and costly to produce.564 We also note that, as with transition plan and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant’s scenario analysis disclosure disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor.565 The final rule provides that, if a registrant uses scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate -related risks on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, and i f, based on the results of scenario analysis, a r egistrant determines that a climate -related risk is reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, then the registrant must describe each such scenario,567 including a brief description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used, as well as the expected material impacts, including financial impacts, on the registrant under each such scenario.568 We are adopting this disclosure requirement because, if a registrant has used scenario analysis to assess and manage a material climate- related risk, investors need to understand how it conducted that analysis in order to evaluate the registrant’s conclusions regarding material impacts on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. By requiring disclosure based on whether a registrant has determined to conduct scenario analysis as part of its consideration of material climate -related risks, a registrant will be able to select the climate scenario model or models that it believes best fits its particular industry or business, or its climate risk assessment approach. To further streamline the scenario analysis disclosure requirement, we have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information.575 We recognize that, as noted by some commenters, scenario analysis practices are still evolving,576 and that, in the early stages of use, a registrant’s disclosure regarding its use of scenario analysis may be qualitative. As a registrant’s use of scenario analysis becomes more sophisticated, we would expect its disclosure of the results of scenario analysis to become more quantitative, particularly when discussing the expec ted material financial impacts on the registrant’s business strategy, under each considered scenario, which, like the proposed rule, must be addressed should a registrant be required to disclose its use of scenario analysis. At the same time, we recognize commenters’ concern that, without a materiality qualifier, the proposed rule could have result ed in the disclosure of internal carbon pricing data that would require registrants to disclose more information about the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing, including the scope of the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing and the impact of such use on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is likely to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate- related risk when responding to other final rule provisions, such as when describing a related transition plan, 229617 even if the description of internal carbon pricing is less detailed because it is part of a broader narrative discussion. have eliminated from the final rule the proposed requirement s to disclose the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.618 By streamlining the internal carbon price disclosure requirement in this way and adding materiality qualifiers, the final rules will help ensure that investors receive material disclosure about the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing to inform their investment and voting decisions while limiting the compliance burden for registrant s. 620 Because of these changes to the proposed rule, we believe that it is unnecessary to adopt an exemption or excep tion to the internal carbon price disclosure requirement, as some commenters recommended,621 or a separate phase in for the disclosure requirement, as recommended by other commenters.622 618 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. Specifically, we are eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose: • The identi ty of specific board members responsible for climate -related oversight; • Whether any board member has expertise in climate- related risks and the nature of the expertise; • How frequently the board is informed of such risks ; and • Information regarding whether and how the board sets climate -related targets or goals, including interim targets or goals. While the proposal would have required this disclosure only to the extent applicable, we appreciate the concerns of some commenters who stated that these elements of the proposal could have unintended effects on the board’s governance structure and processes by focusing on one area of ris k that is disclosed 669 or influence the board’s transition process by focusing on one area of ris k that is disclosed 669. If a board of directors determines to oversee a particular risk, the fact of such ove rsight being exercised by the board is likely material to investors given other demands on the board’s time and attention.672 Moreover, unlike management, which likely oversees climate -related positions or expertise, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to investors, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to the company and limited in number. The final rule requires registrants to disclose information about their management oversight of climate -related risks, except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant’s principal line of business.708 c.

However, consistent with our overall goal to streamline the proposed requirements and to focus on management’s over sight of material climate -related risk, we are not including such additional disclosure elements in the final rule.710 We are adopting the proposal requir ing a description of the relevant expertise of position holders or members responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risk.711 While we considered the view of commenters that this could cause registrants t o feel compelled to find and hire management with such expertise, regardless of whether that is the most sensible use of managerial resources given the registrant’s particular climate -related facts and circumstances, the added qualification that disclosure is only required where the risk is material. , letter from Chamber (“ We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk., letter from Chamber (“ We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk. While supra registrants may be required to disclose certain climate -related information in filings made with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure requirements, as noted above 730 there is a need to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of disclosures about c limate -related risk management for investors given that, as noted above, most r egistrants are not currently including the type of information called for by the final rules in voluntary climate reports or Exchange Act filings.770 We also considered comments that the proposal placed undue emphasis on climate -related risks and, as discussed below, have made a number of changes in response to streamline the requirements and focus on materia l climate - related risks. The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks.773 The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks. In addition, because the processes and factors that a registrant may use to identify the two types of risks may differ in certain respects, or in some cases a registrant may face one and not the other kind of risk, this change should elicit more relevant information for investors.775 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule also provides that a registrant should address, as applicable, how it: • Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk;776 and • 785s whether to address the climate -related risk.777 The final rules will help investors to understand the processes that a registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing climate -related risks, consistent with the feedback of many commenters.778 In this regard, commenters further indicated that information concerning how a registrant prioritizes climate -related risks vis --vis other risks that the registrant is managing would be particularly useful.779 We are not, however, retaining the proposed requirement to disclose how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high priority risks.787 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b), and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant’s climate -related targets or goals in order to understand and assess the registrant ’s transition risk strategy and how the registrant is manag ing the material impacts of its identified climate -related risks. We recognize, however, as some commenters indicated, that an overly broad requirement to disclose any climate -related target or goal, even one that is meant for preliminary, internal planning purposes and that is not yet material, could impose a compliance burden on registrants that may outweigh its benefi t to investors.848 Conditioning the targets and goals disclosure requirement on the target s or goal s being material will help to address this concern by focusing the requirement on the information that is most likely to be decision- useful for investors. 856 See Proposing the proposed rule requires commenters s ection to meet its climate -related targets or goals.857 See Proposing the proposed rule requires commenters s ection to meet its climate -related targets or goals.853 These disclosures will allow investors to better understand a registrant s targets or goals and how it intends to achieve them, which will help investors better assess a registrant’s transition risks and make more informed investment and voting decisions. 859 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule (Item 1504(c)) will require a registrant to disclose any progress toward meeting the target or goal and how such progress has been achieved.860 Also similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will req uire the registrant to update this disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or goals. Relatedly, the final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal.863 This disc ussion must include quantitative and qualitative 859 See letter from Unilever. A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of climate -related offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the extent to which the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets or RECs ; the nature of the offsets or RECs ; and the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. 878 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812. Relatedly, a registrant that relies on carbon offsets or RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve its targets or goals might need to consider whether fluctuating supply or demand, and corresponding variability of price, related to c arbon offsets or RECs, pr esents an additional material risk that is required to be disclosed when discussing its plan to achieve such target or goal pursuant the requirements of subpart 1500. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant’s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant’s business and financial condition. 891 The Commission also proposed to require a registrant to disclose its Scope 2 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or 888 We proposed to define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO 2”); methane (“CH 4”); nitrous oxide (“N 2O”); nitrogen trifluoride (“NF 3”); hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”); perfluorocarbons (“PFCs”); and sulfur hexafluoride (“SF 6”). the Exchange Act annual report.1001 Commenters recommended varying GHG emissions disclosure deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10-Q.100 Commenters recommended varying GHG emissions disclosure deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10-Q. We recognize commenters’ concerns about the potentially high cost of compliance associated with the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement, including Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1009 as well as concerns about th e current availability and reliability of the underlying data for Scope 3 emissions.1010 To help address these concerns, instead of requiring, as proposed, the disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by all registrants regardless of their materiality, the final rules will require the disclosure of Scope 1 emissions and /or Scope 2 em issions metrics1011 by LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs, on a phased in basis,1012 if such emissions are material.1013 1008 See, e.g. 1017 If a registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than a n SRC or EGC and its Scope 1 emissions are material but its Scope 2 emissions are not material, then, under the final rules, the registrant must disclose its Scope 1 emissions and is not required to disclose its Scope 2 emissions (and vice versa if its Scope 2 emissions are material but its Scope 1 emissions are not). A registrant’s Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions may be material because the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to allow investors to understand whether those emissions are significant enough to subject the registrant to a transition risk that will or is reasonably likely to materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition in the short - or long- term. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources and time to prepare for what we acknowledge could be a significant additional compliance obligation.1024 We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. Nevertheless, mindful of the attendant costs, we believe that the final rules present an appropriate means to achieve the primary benefits of GHG emissions disclosure, namely: providing investors with material metrics that will aid in the assessment of transition risk for those registrants that have identified a material climate risk ; and facilitating investors ’ evaluation of a registrant’s progress towards achieving a material target or goal and the attendant effects on the registrant’s business, resul ts of operations, or financial condition. While the final GHG emissions disclosure provision will not apply to as many registrants or achieve the same level of comparability as may have been achieved under the proposed rules, on balance, we believe that, coupled with the other disclosures required under subpart 1500 and the structured data requirements of the final rules, investors will have sufficient information to assess the operational and financial impact of transition risks and strategies on registrants and compare such impacts across registrants. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure (120:1197 Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Disclosure Compliance Date Limited Assurance Compliance Date Reasonable Assurance Compliance Date LAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033 AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs) Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A AFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report under the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1) (i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. We considered the view expressed by some commenters that there is no reason to treat GHG emissions disclosures differently than other disclosures located outs ide of the financial statements, which do not require assurance.1210 Although we recognize that registrants may provide quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements that is not subject to any assurance requirement, a s explained in the Proposi ng Release,1211 and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters,1212 GHG emissions disclosures are unique in that many companies currently voluntarily seek third- party assurance over their climate- related disclosures, and commenters, including investor s, have expressed a particular need for assurance over GHG 1207 See, e.g. See Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance), available at https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_1222.01.0015.01.ENG (requiring companies within its jurisdiction to obtain limited assurance over sustainability reporting and sta ting that the European Commission will perform an assessment to determine if moving from limited to reasonable assurance is feasible for both auditors and companies); SB -253, Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (Oct. 1225 However, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules will exempt SRC s and EGCs from the requirement to obtain an attestation report.1226 Although some commenters urged the Commission to apply the final rules to all registrants,1227 not just AFs and LAFs, our decision to exempt SRCs and EGCs from the assurance requirement is d riven by our decision to exempt these companies from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions, which is discussed in greater detail above. Under the final rules, AFs and LAFs will be required to obtain limited assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505 (the GHG emissions disclosure provision). For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance engagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the engagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. 1244 We agree with commenters that extending the phase in periods would provide registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers with additional time to prepare for implementation of the rules and would allow assurance standards and practices applicable to 1243 See supra note 1193; Brandon Gipper, et al. See also letters from GRI (“Reasonable assurance should be adopted as this would be commensurate with the level of assurance provided through statutory audits of financial statements and will give information users increased confidence that t he reported information is prepared in accordance with stated criteria.”); and PWYP (“Given the importance of GHG emissions data to enable investors to fully understand the climate -related risks of issuers, reasonable assurance is necessary to ensure that information is subjected to sufficient examination and verification such that it can be relied on by investors.”). As discussed above, the final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates, or may be included in an amended annual report on Form 10- K no later than the due date for such Form 10- Q.1255 The extension of the deadline for the filing of GHG emissions metrics assurance also applies to the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emissions disclosure to which the report applies.1256 This additional time —an additional two fiscal q uarters —should provide registrants subject to Item 1505 and their GHG emissions attestation providers with sufficient time to measure GHG emissions, provide assurance, and prepare the required attestation report. Consistent with the notice requirements in cluded in Item 1505(c), the final rules (Item 1506(f)) provide that a registrant that elects to incorporate by reference its attestation report from its Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter or to provide its attestation report in an amended annual repor t must include an express statement in its annual Such filer would be required to follow the requirements of Item s 1506(b) through (d), including using the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, which was supported by one commenter.1264 Although in the Proposing Release, the requirements outlined in this paragraph would have applied to any climate -related disclosures not subject to assurance under Item 1506(a),1265 we have narrowed the scope of the final rule to apply only to GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured under Item 1506(a) because, given the requirement in t he final rule material, we think it is unlikely that registrants will voluntarily obtain assurance over non -GHG emissions disclosure for which the disclosure required by 1506(e) would be useful to investors. 1359 We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. See 1592 See supra notes 1300 and 1301 and accompanying text. 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). In this regard, we note that the IAASB and ISO standards, two of the four standards we are explic itly permitting assurance providers to use under the final rules (as discussed in more detail below), are not restricted to CPAs, and we are not aware that any state laws are currently impacting the ability of non -CPA service providers to provide assurance over GHG emissions. 1369 Namely, the final rules provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all iss ues encompassed within the attestation provider’s engagement, which is modeled on Rule 2- 01(b). However, we agree that the proposed rule would not prohibit the disclosure of the registrant’s independence information with respect to the accompanying auditor’s fees, including the disclosure of the registrant’s GHG emissions data from the accompanying attestation provider.1370 Along those lines, existing Commission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2- 01 do not apply to the independence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or interpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly p resented under Item 1506 (which is a possibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2- 01), the guidance or interpretation would be a useful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371 We considered the concern raised by commenters tha t requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially increase costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant’s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). For example, with respect to its mining disclosure rules, the Commission stated that it was not adopting a requirement for a qualified person to be independent from the registrant because, among other thi ngs, the final rules require a registrant to disclose the qualified person’s affiliated status with the registrant or another entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, which is consistent with its mining guidelines. practice among some registrants of obtaining third -party assurance over their GHG emissions data.1381 Although generally the independence requirements in the assurance standards currently being used with respect to GHG emissions data are not as robust as the requirements in the final rules, many of these standards include requirements related to the objectivity and impartiality of the third -party assurance provider.1382 Therefore, the final rules’ independence requirement is not inconsistent with the general practice in this space of retaining an objective and impartial third -party to provide assurance.1383 In addition, we are adopting the definition of “affiliate” as p roposed and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters that addressed this issue.1384 Similarly, we are adopting the broad definition of “a ttestation and professional engagement period” as proposed, which is modeled on the definition of “audit and professional engagement standards” in Rule 2 -01.1385 As discussed in greater detail above, in response to a request for comment, some commenters recommended that the Commission require the GHG emissions attestation provider 1381 See supra note 1232. Although the final rules do not include a requirement that a registrant’s audit committee pre-approve the GHG emissions attestation services, nor was such a requirement proposed, it would be permissible under the final rules for a registrant to use the auditor of its financial statements to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagement, assuming the final rules’ requirements for assurance providers are met. See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant’s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagements for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered “Audit -Related Fees” for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -A, Item 14 of Form 10 -B, Item 14 of Form 10 -C, Item 14 of Form 10 -D, Item 14 of Form 10 -F, Item 14 of Form 10 -G, Item 14 of Form 10 -H, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -J, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -L, Item 14 of Form 10 -M, Item 14 of Form 10 Although not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their incentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would result in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential downsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted above,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment of an accountant’s report on unaudited interim financial statements included in a registration statement, which is also provided at the limited assurance level. 1399 However, we think it is nonetheless important that a GHG emissions attestation provider have some awareness about whether its attestation report is included in a 1397 In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers which are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level. Further, to help facilitate registrants’ compliance with the requirement to file the letter from the GHG emissions attestation provider as an exhibit, we have included an instruction to Item 1506 that directs registrants obtaining assurance at a limited assurance level to Item 601(b)(27) ( as well as to paragraph 18 of Form 20- F’s Instructions as to Exhibits, as discussed infra note 1402 and accompanying text ). included in a registration statement.1403 We also note, as discussed above, that certain commenters stated that deeming the information expertized may have the effect of deterring or reducing available assurance providers.1404 We believe the approach we have taken appropriately addresses these co ncerns by exempting the GHG emissions attestation providers that perform limited assurance engagements from section 11 liability and the consent requirements associated with expertized reports, and requiring consent with corresponding section 11 liability only when the heightened level of review associated with reasonable assurance makes it appropriate for the report to be expertized. This bifurcated approach to reasonable versus limited assurance engagements is consistent with the current treatment of audited financial statements and unaudited (reviewed) interim financial statements.1405 While we recognize underwriters and other non- issuer defendants subject to potential liability under section 11 may face additional due diligence requirements during the transition 1471 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). 1475 This approach will not only reduce the costs of complying with the final rules1476 but will likely b enefit investors by leveraging the experience that GHG emissions attestation providers already have with particular standards, which could lead to assurance engagements being performed with a greater level of skill initially than if GHG emissions attestation providers were required to gain expertise with an unfamiliar standard. 1478 The ISO TC 207/SC7 is the technical committee responsible for the development of ISO 14064- 3 – Greenhouse gases – Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of greenhouse gas s tatements.1479 The committee includes members from 120 countries, each represented by the country’s national standards body, and the committee also includes representatives from 32 organizations who monitor standards development activities and can provide input during standards development. 1488 The final rules (Item 1506(c)) require the form and content of the GHG emissions attestation report to follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards used, as proposed; however, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules do not prescribe minimum report requirements. 1489 The Commission expla ined in the Proposing Release that the proposed minimum components were all common elements of current assurance reports,1490 a point that was affirmed in the feedback we received from commenters.1491 We continue to expect that the attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules will generally 1486 See supra note 1430 and accompanying text. To the extent the AF or LAF disclosed Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for a historical period, it would not be required to obtain an assurance report covering such historical period in the first year of the attestation rule’s applicability. 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criteria” against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol’s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia” against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1505 This commenter asked the Commission to clarify whether, to the extent the Commission permits the use of standards other than those developed by the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB, the Commission should clarify “whether all practitioners should be required to consider ‘other information’ in the same way as registrants.” 1503 The GHG emissions attestation provider must perform the engagement in accordance with t he requirements included in the attestation standard being used. Accordingly, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to disclose certain information when there is a change in, and disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider as discussed in greater detail below.1543 The decision not to adopt a requirement for a registrant to disclose whether its GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required, thus re ducing the burden associated with the final rules. The AICPA’s peer review program and PCAOB’s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs that a GHG emissions attestation provider may be subject to generally; however, only the AICPA’s peer review program would include within its scope the GHG emissions attestation engagement. As stated above, the Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing Release asking if it should require disclosure when there is a change in, or disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider that is similar to the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K.1558 The commenters that responded to the request for comment generally agreed with including such a requirement in the final rules.1559 Because we believe that requiring the disclosure of information regarding changes in, and disagreements with, a GHG emissions attestation provider would provide investors with important information about the provider and the conduct of the attestation engagement, which investors need to help them assess the reliability of the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures, we have included a provision in the final rules that will require AFs and LAFs subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose the extent to which the registrant’s former GHG emissions attestation provider resigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re -appointment after completion of the attestation engagement) or is dismissed. 1563 We have generally modeled this aspect of the final ru les on the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K, tailored to fit the context of 1566 This definition and explanation is consistent with Item 304 of Regulation S -K and its Instructions, with minor modifications to take into account the circumstances of a GHG emissions attestation engagement.1567 We have determined to take an incremental approach to requiring disclosure about the resignation or dismissal of a GHG emissions attestation provider and therefore have not included a requirement for the registrant to request the former GHG emissions attes tation provider to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the registrant with respect to the resignation or dismissal and disagreement (if applicable). The final rules, howeve r, do not preclude a registrant from disclosing its explanation of the dismissal or resignation to its former GHG emissions attestation provider, and although not required, we encourage any GHG emissions attestation provider to convey concerns it has with the registrant’s description of those events to the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3C emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute “forward -looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : • 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); • 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); • 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and • 17 CFR 229.1504 (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro m CEMEX. For example, a statement of plans to transiti on to more efficient operations or a different mix of products or ser vices made in response to Item 1502( d), Item 1502( e), or Item 1504 (targets and goals) would likely constitute a forward- looking statement. For example, a statement of future economic performance made pursuant to Items 1502(d), Item 1504, or Item 303 of Regulation S -K would likely constitute a forward -looking statement. We also believe that a safe harbor for these disclosures wi ll help incentivize more comprehensive disclosures on these matters to the benefit of investors.1688 Statements made by i ssuers and /or in connection with transactions that will be eligible for the final rule s’ safe harbor include forward -looking statements that will be eligible for the final rule s’ safe harbor include forward -looking statements : made in connection with an offering of securities by a blank check company;1690 made with respect to the business or operations of an issuer of penny stock; made in connection with a rollup transaction; or made in connection with an IPO,1691 or in connection with an offering by, or relating to the operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program.1692 1688 See supra note 1640 and accompanying text. 1689 In addition to issuers, consistent with the PSLRA safe harbors, the safe harbor will apply to: a person acting on behalf of the issuer; an outside reviewer retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of the issuer; or an underwriter, with respect to information provided by the issuer or information derived from information provided by the issuer. We are not using our exemptive authority to extend the PSLRA safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(A) (specified “bad actors”); (ii) forward looking -statements contained in a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company as specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(B); and (iii) forward -looking statements made by an issuer in a going- private transaction, see section 27A(b)(1)(E) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(E), in connection with a tender offer, see Securities Act section 27A(b)(2)(C) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(C), or in a beneficial ownership report required to be filed pursuant to s ection 13(d) of the Exchange Act, see Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(F) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(F). Specifically, the Commission proposed that if a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by proposed s ubpart 1500 in a f iling that also requires audited financial statements, then the registrant would be required to disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated financial statement metrics.1704 The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: • Financial Impact Metrics;1705 • Expenditure Metrics; and • Financial Estimates and Assumptions.1706 The proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required disclosure of the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions and any efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on the line items in a registrant’s financial statement. 1941, and we expect registrants to be required to disclose the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions on the line items in a registrant’s financial statement. Moreover, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s,1942 the requirements we are adopting will provide many of the same benefits of transparency and insights that the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided, albeit without as much detail, which should reduce the burden on registrants. In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii, we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants ’ financial reporting obligations. Therefore, a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics.1946 Therefore, a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. The final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters. The proposed rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters. Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics only required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to the mitigation of risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions, the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions because tho se costs would have constituted line -item impacts to a registrant’s financial statements. In response to commenter requests for additional clarity,2001 we are prescribing an attribution principle that registrants must use to determine whether a capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss is “as a result of” a severe weather event or other natural condition.2002 The attribution principle will also simplify the determination of the amount required to be dis closed by eliminating the need to allocate portions of costs and expenditures, which will reduce compliance costs for registrants.2003 Under the final rules, t he requirement to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions remain s subject to a one percent disclosure threshold; however, we are modifying the denominators used for the threshold and adopting de minimis thresholds that exempt disclosure of amounts that aggregate to less than $100,000 in the income statement or less than $500,000 in the balance sheet, as explained in greater Although we are not adopting the broader requirement for di sclosure of transition activities in the financial statements, registrants will be required to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs in the financial statements.2011 The proposed rules identified the amount of expense d or capitalized 2008 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2014 Furthermore, although the final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise exposure to transition risks in the financial statements, the final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrants to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances as described in greater detail above,2015 which should result in the disclosure of some of the information for expenditures related to transition activities that we would have expected to be disclosed under the proposed rules, albeit outside of the financial statements. , ASC 230 Statement of Cash flows (requir ing classification of cash receipts and cash payments as resulting from operating, investing, and financing activities ); ASC 280 Segments (noting that a registrant “shall disclose both of the following about each reportable segment if the specified amounts ar e included in the determination of segment assets reviewed by the chief operating decision maker or are otherwise regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, even if not included in the determination of segment assets...(b) total expenditures for additions to long -lived assets...” ) (ASC 280-10-50-25); and ASC 730 Research and Development ( requir ing disclosure of the total research and development costs charged to expense in each period for which an income statement is presented) (ASC 730 -10-50-1). However, registrants may consider whether disaggregating material cash outflows to acquire property, plant, and equipment2020 purchased to meet the registrant’s transition plans, targets, or goals on the statement of cash flows or in a related note is appropriate to provide complete information about the entity’s cash flows for the period. Under the final rules, registrants are required to disclose the aggregate amount s of (1) carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) carbon offsets and RECs Proposed requirement or questioned what disclosure objective it was intended to achieve.2029 Because the final rules we are adopting are more narrowly focu sed on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, we do not think it would be in keeping with this approach to also require a registr ant to disclose the impacts from any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to Item 1502(a). See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2) Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision -useful disclosure information about registrants ’ capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. In a further shift from the propos al, we have included de minimis thresholds in the final rules.2047 As dis cussed above, some commenters expressed the view that the proposed one percent disclosure threshold would place an unreasonable burden on smaller companies because it is more likely that the impacts on smaller companies would exceed the one percent disclos ure threshold.2048 In addition, a few commenter s mentioned a de minimis exception in their letter s.2049 We recognize the possibility that a one percent disclosure threshold could be disproportionately burdensome for smaller companies or companies in the earl y stages of developing a product or business line for which one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit or stockholders’ equity or deficit could be a very small amount. As discussed in greater detail below, the final rules also include an attribution principle that limits the required disclos ure to circumstances where the severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant contributing factor in incurring the capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss.2054 The final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules —stockholders’ equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit — are aggregated amounts and therefore we expect that in many instances they will result in a larger denominator than what was included in the proposal. Some commenters also raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures relative to the impacts of other risks disclosed in the financial statement s or could suggest a level of precision that does not exist.2055 However, the final rules require disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges e, and l osses that are currently recorded in the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP, and therefore the disclosures should have the same degree of precision as the other information provided in the financial statements. , letters from BHP (“Further, while we acknowledge that the Commission currently uses a specific 1% threshold for certain disclosures, we note that the disclosure examples provided by the Commission are generally narrow in scope, factual in nature and limited to certain line items in the financial statements (for example, the amount of excise taxes included in revenue)”); Ernst & Young LLP (“But we note that, unlike the climate -related impacts, excise taxes are discrete event charges that are easily calculated and tracked in a registrants accounting books and records.”); and IADC (“The Commission argues that a 1% quantitative threshold is used in other contexts, but the examples the Commission cites are circumstances where the quantitative amounts involved are knowable under current accounting practice, have discrete impacts on specific financial line items, and address scenarios in which more detailed disclosure is appropriate. See also letter from CFA Institute (“We would also observe that existing U.S. See also letter from CFA Institute (“We would also observe that existing U.S. Second, the “significant contributing factor” principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor resulting in the registrant incurring the expenditure or re ceiving the recovery, while not requiring disclosure where a severe weather event or other natural condition w as only a minor factor, thereby reducing the cost burden on registrants. 2076 See, e.g., FASB ASC 210 Topic 280 Segment Reporting, FASB ASC 323 Equity Method and Joint Ventures, FASB ASC 810 Consolidations, and FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. However, the final rules require a registrant to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed by a registrant such as a discussion of the composition of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses.2083 Similar to the final rules’ other disclosure requirements, a registrant will be required to identify where the recoveries are presented in the income statement and the b alance sheet.2084 v. Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of “severe weather events and other natural conditions” under the final rules, which we acknowledge are not required to disclose a portion of the registrant’s natural condition risks (i.e. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining “physical risks” to include “acute risks” (including severe weather events) and “chronic risks”); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as examples of “chronic risks.” These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to Regulation S -K. We considered whether the non- exclusive list of examples should be expanded to include other types of severe weather events or other natural conditions identified by commenters in their comment letters;2095 however, we designed the list as non- exhaustive and non -exclusive because we thin k it is more appropriate to take a flexible approach to enable registrants to exercise judgment in identifying severe weather events or other natural conditions based on the impacts those events have on their financial condition. Some commenters asserted that allowing registrants to exercise judgment about which severe weather events or natural conditions to analyze would reduce comparability.2096 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant to every 2093 For exa mple, in determining whether high temperatures constitute a severe natural condition, a relevant factor may include average seasonal temperatures. to severe weather events and other natural conditions to carbon offsets and RECs, using the same trigger fo r disclosure in the amendments to Regulation S -K and the amendments to Regulation S - X will provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the registrant’s use of carbon offsets and RECs, which will help investors evaluate the role of these instrum ents in a registrant’s climate -related strategy and help them assess the likely financial effects of a disclosed material transition risk.2105 In addition, the final rules require registrants to disclose the beginning and ending balances of capitalized car bon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year.2106 The beginning and ending balances of carbon offsets and RECs are an important data point for investors to understand as they assess a registrant ’s transition risks. weather events and other natural conditions.2111 Under the final rules, registrants must separately aggregate the (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered and for purposes of disclosure.2112 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses must be segregated between the balance sheet and the income statement depending on which financial statement the y are recorded within the calendar year. The registrant would determine whether the financial statement effects as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the thresholds, as illustrated below: Expenditure Category Current Fiscal Year Balances (Stockholders’ Equity from Balance Sheet, Income or Loss Before Income Tax Expense or Benefit from Income Statement) Severe Weather Event A Natural Condition B Severe Weather Event C Percentage Impact Balance Sheet (capitalized costs and charges) $150,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,750,000 1.97% Income Statement (expenditures expensed as incurred and losses) $75,000,000 $750,000 $2,000,000 3.67% In the above example, the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event A was $1,200,000 (capitalized on balance sheet), the capitalized cost, charge, and loss incurred as a result of Natural Condition B was $1,750,000 (charge on balance sheet and loss in income statement of $750,00 and capitalized cost of $1,000,000 on the balance sheet), and the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event C was $2,000,000 (expense in the income statement). Similar to the examples of disclosure that were included in the proposed rules, t he final rules state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of expenditure s expensed and losses as incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, relocate assets or operations affected by the event or condition, retire affected assets, repair affected assets, recognize impairment loss of affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2 The final rules also state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, retire affected assets, replace or repair affected assets, recognize an impairment charge for affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2121 4. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and 2120 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c). The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. GAAP and IFRS require the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions in many circumstances,2181 including significant inputs associated with material estimates and assumptions, the final rules will enhance transparency and consistency by requiring registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed 2177 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. In addition, although we agree with commenters that the proposed requirements share similarities with critical accounting estimates,2182 we do not think those disclosures obviate the need for this requirement because the final rules go further by requiring specific disclosure about how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. Proposed Rule s The proposed rule s would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate -related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K, on any of the financial statement metrics.2188 The Proposing Release explained that if a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the impact of a climate -related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so consistently ( e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the 2185 See supra note 2157 and accompanying text. The requirement in the final rules to d is requiring capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed 2217 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3 (stating, in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics, that a registrant may choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities but remaining silent with respect to opportunities for costs and expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions). The requirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Proposed Rule s In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that because the proposed financial statement metrics would involve estimation uncertainties driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other financial statement disclosures, registrants would be required to disclose conte xual information to enable a reader to understand how it derived the financial statement metrics, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the metrics. On the other hand, commenters raised concerns that certain of the proposed financial statement metrics would not necessarily comport with GAAP, including amounts for lost revenues, cost savings, or cost reductions.2246 In addition, in response to a question in the Proposing Release, certain commenters stated that the proposed financial statement metrics should be calculated at a reportable segment level when a registrant has more than one reportable segment, as defined by FASB Topic 280. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects.2252 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting may involve estimation uncertaintytie s that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, like certain other financial statement disclosures, ASC 210,2253 and therefore disclosure of contextual information will facilitate investors’ understanding of the financial statement effects and will be an integral part of the financial statements. We have decided to include “significant judgments” as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures, and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures.2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions. We are also adopting the requirements ( Rule 14-01(c)) for registrants to calculate the financial statement effects using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the r egistrant’s consolidated financial statements and to apply the same set of accounting principles that a registrant is required to apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements, consistent with the proposal. 2262 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, requiring registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosures using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements w ill avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency, and aid comparability. 2263 In addition, we agree with the commenter who stated that applying the same set of accounting principles to the financial statement disclosures will aid comparability.2264 We are not aware of any cumstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP, and therefore we are striking the words “[w]henever applicable” from the final rules, in response to the commenter who stated that this phrase was confusing because it could i mply that 2262 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(c). We understand that a number of commenters raised concerns about applying PCAOB standards and stated that additional guidance would be needed.2359 The modifications made to the final rules to narrow their scope to capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses derived from transactions and amounts recorded in registrant’ s books and records underlying the financial statements and material ly impacted estimates and assumptions, along with the Commission’ s adoption of an attribution principle, will help to mitigate commenters’ concerns about the auditability of the disclosures. 2362 See supra notes 2306 and 2308 and accompanying text. However, PCAOB -registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient, appropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law.2366 Moreover, PCAOB - registered accounting firms are subject to periodic inspection by the PCAOB and are required to comply with PCAOB rules. 2369 PCAOB AS 3101.08 states that the first section of the auditor’s report must include a “statement identifying each financial statement and any related schedule(s) that has been audited” and a “statement indicating that the financial statements, including the related notes and any related schedule(s), identified and collectively referred to in the report as the financial statements, were audited.” 2370 2367 See supra notes 2337 -2339 and accompanying text. As the disclosure requirements we are adopting will be included in a note to the foreign private issuer’s financial statements and based on information that is recognized and measured in the foreign private issuer’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, they will be within the scope of the statement by the registrant’s auditor that the financial statements “including any related notes” were audited. Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20- F, and the forms that refer to Form 20- F (including Forms F -1 and F -3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements prepared in accor dance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, proposed Article 14 disclosure was nevertheless required (similar to disclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S -X).'"

              "\"The Commission is adopting final rule s ( Item 1502(a) to require the disclosure of any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant. The final rules are responsive to investors’ need for decision -useful information regarding registran ts’ material climate-related risks. In addition, because a registrant may be able to assess the material risks posed by its value chain, this change will also limit the burdens of climate risk assessment on third parties. The final rules’ definition of “ transition risk s” includes the same non- 323 See, e.g., letter from Chamber. Final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk. Some commenters opposed proposed Item 1502 because in their view it would be difficult to distinguish between a climate -related physical risk and an ordinary weather risk. The final rule s include several changes from the proposal that mitigate some of the burdens of Item 1502(a), as it was proposed. The proposal would have called for specific information about physical risks, such as disclosures relating to flooding and the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high water stress. It also includes a non- exclusive list of disclosures the registrant must provide, as applicable, including whether the transition risk relates to regulatory, technological, market, or other transition -related factors. Describing the nature of an identified transition risk in this manner will help i nvestors understand the realized or potential material impacts. “over whatever time period is relevant to a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances ”). Some commenters recommended bifurcating the climate risk disclosures into short -term and long- term timeframes, without a medium -term timeframe, similar to certain MD&A disclosures. One of those commenters stated that imposing a different temporal standard for climate risk disclosure would pose meaningful challenges. A s defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important. The materiality determination is fact specific and one that requires both quantitative and qualitative considerations. The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate -related risks. Commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but recommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the most likely and significant impacts. Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule provision was not necessary because the Commission’s existing rules generally require a registrant to disclose the effects of material effects. The list, which is intended to be non- exclusive, includes, as applicable, material impacts on the registrant’s. If none of the listed types of impacts or any other impacts are material, a registrant need not disclose them. The final rule will help elicit more meaningful and relevant disclosure without overburdening registrants or investors. Corp. Gov. forward -looking disclosures,”438 which should provide registrants with more flexibility to determine the appropriate disclosures needed in response to the requirement. We also have eliminated the requirement to describe how any of the financial statement metrics or GHG emissions metrics relate to the registrant’s business model or business strategy. The final rules refer to the regis trant’s “business, results of operations, and financial condition ” rather than “consolidated financial statements.” This is to reflect that the type of disclosure that is intended by this provision is more similar to that found in MD&A. The final Regulation S-X provisions that we are adopting, on the other hand, do not cover financial impacts caused by transition risks. This Regulation S -K provision, therefore, will elicit disclosure s about material expenditures related to activ ities engaged in for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate -related risks. The Commission proposed to require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate -related risk management strategy to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks. The proposed requirements were int ended to help investors understand how a. registrant intends to address identified climate-related risks and any transition. to a lower carbon economy. Investors have sought more detailed disclosure about transition plans. A registrant’s transition plan may have a significant impact on its overall business strategy. The final rule does not list the types of transition risks and factors related to those risks that must be disclosed. We disagree with commenters who stated that this updating requirement would result in disclosure of information that is not meaningful for investors. We do not expect that it would be particularly burdensome for the company to disclose update d information about actions taken under the plan on a going forward basis. Disclosure of the steps a registrant intends to make under a transition plan, and whether it has taken those steps, will help investors assess the financial impacts of the plan. To avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment, such disclosure is most appropriate. A registrant will not be required to comply with either provision until the fiscal year immediately following the fisca l year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status. 527 See 17 CFR 229.1503, discussed infra section II. F. investors about how a registrant intends to reduce its exposure to a material transition ris k while limiting the burdens on registrants.528 Modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to focus on material exp enditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions will help to mitigate this concern. 529 While the final rules seek neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the adoption of transition plans, we recognize that the compliance burdens of disclosure may influence some registrants’ decisions with respect to risk management practices. Investors have increasingly sought information from registrants about their use of scenario analysis and expressed a need for improved disclosure about such use. The final rule’s scenario analysis disclosure requirement will depend on whether and how a registrant use s such analysis. The rule will not require a ny registrant to conduct scenario analysis. We are, however, adopting modifications in the final rules. We have deleted from the definition the example that “registrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies un der certain future climate scenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 °C,. 567 See 17 CFR 229.1502(f). Conversely, if a registrant conducts scenario analysis and determines from its results that it is not likely to be materially impacted by a climate -related risk, no disclosure about its use of scenario analysis is required. The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered “ an increase of no greater than 3 ºC, 2 ¼C, or 1.5 ¹C above pre-industrial levels.” We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. We decline to follow the recommendation of one commenter who stated that disclosure of scenario analysis should only be required when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative. g).g.g. g.g (G.g). G.G. (g.G). g.G (g,g) (g),g.h (g,.g), g.H (g.,g), G.H. (h,g,h), g,g. The final rule will require disclosure only when a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing is material to how it evaluates and manages a climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) We are requir ing disclosure of this information because, as commenters noted, it will help investors understand a registrants’ internal carbon Pricing practice. We also have included a provision, similar to the rule proposal, stating that if the scope of entities and operations involved in the use of a described internal carbon price i s materially different than the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of calculating GHG emissions, the registrant must briefly describe this difference. We are adopting the proposed requirement s to disclose board oversight of climate -related risks. We are also adding Instructio n 1 to Item 1501 to clarify that in the case of a foreign private issuer with a two-tier board of director s, the term “ board of directors ” means the supervisory or non -management board. The final rule s will provide investors with the information they need to understand and evaluate those oversight arrangements. Proposal would require registrants to disclose board committee or subcommittee responsible for oversight of climate -related risks. Final rule will avoid generating detailed disclosure about matters that are not important to investors. Final rules balance investors’ need to understand board’s governance of climate-related risks with concerns that the proposal could inadvertently pressure registrants. The Commission is adopting the proposed requirement to disclose management oversight of climate related risks (Ite m 1501(b) with some modifications. The final rule s will, like the proposed rules, require that registrants describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate -related risks. However, we are limiting the disclosure required by this final rule provision to material climate-related risks, as suggested by commenters. ......... What do you think?

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of photos. We agree with commenters that this information will be helpful to understanding a registrant’s ability to manage climate -related risk s. We emphasize that registrants are required to make this disclosure only if they have identified a material climate risk. The final rule has been modified to eliminate many of the prescriptive disclosure elements from the proposal. The Proposed Rule, if adopted, would present a costly distraction for companies with limited resources (particularly small- cap and many mid- cap companies) to attempt to align their behavior and disclosures with those of other companies. We are adopting a less prescriptive approach that focuses on a description of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks. If a registrant has not identified a material climate -related risk, no disclosure is required. A materiality qualifier addresses the specific concerns expressed by commenters that the proposal would require registrants to disclose this information in a level of detail that would impose undue costs. We have removed several prescriptive elements from the final rule. The final rule will elicit disclosures that offer a more complete picture of the management of material climate-related risks. 780 See supra note 733 and 734 and accompanying text. reduce the prescriptiveness of the risk management disclosure requirement and streamline this requirement, as we have done with other areas of the final rule s. In response to one commenter who supported the proposal but cautioned against an overly broad application,781 we confirm that the final rules do not require registrants to speculate in their disclosures about future restructurings. If a registrant sets an internal target or goal that materially affect s or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition, then investors should have access to information about that target. We decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters that the targets and goals disclosure requirement should only be triggered by the board's or CEO's formal adoption of the target. The final rules do not include “emissions” in the list of information that must be disclosed if necessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of a target or goal. We are not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by the regis trant. Final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal. No update about targets or goals would be required if the underlying target s or goals are not required to be disclosed. 873 This provision will help to eliminate redundancies in the s ubpart 1500 disclosure. 874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. 875 A registrant may elect to provide disclosure regarding these additi onal items, but they are not required items of disclosure. In addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items. The final rules, including those pertaining to the use of offsets or RECs, are neutral regarding any strategy that a registrant may choose to manage a material climate-related risk. Proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions888 for its most recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements. We proposed to define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO 2”); methane (‘CH 4’); nitrous oxide (’N 2O’), nitrogen trifluoride (� ‘NF 3’) and hydrofluorocarbons. Final rules include a Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure requirement, although modified from the rule proposal. LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs will be required to comply with the final rule’s GHG emissions disclosure requirements. The TCFD recently reported that only 30% of North American companies surveyed reported their Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions in 2021. We acknowledge that registrants could incur costs to assess and monitor the materiality of emissions, even in situations in which they determine that they do not need to provide such information. We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. We are further limiting the GHG emissions disclosure requirement to LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs and on a phased in basis. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources. Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure. The final rules do not require an AF to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level. The benefits that assurance will provide in terms of investor protection and increased confidence in GHG emissions disclosure warrants requiring attestation. We recognize commenters’ concerns about the potential cost of obtaining assurance, the pote ntial shortage in the current supply of assurance providers, and the continually evolving state of assurance standards and methodologies. Several commenters urged the Commission to adopt the verification process for GHG reporting used by the EPA in lieu of the proposed assurance requirements. The practice of providing assurance over GHG emissions is far from nascent and is now expected by many market participants. We agree with commenters that requiring registrants to disclose whether they obtained voluntary assurance and related details w ould help those investors in companies that voluntarily obtain assurance. The assurance requirements in the final rules are narrowly tailored and limited to a subset of registrants, many of which already obtain assurance services. We disagree with those commenters that suggested we wait before determining whether to adopt a mandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions. The phase in periods included in the 1221 See supra notes 1131 and 1132 and accompanying text. 1234 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500- and-esg-reporting. 1235 See, e.g., letter from INGAA. 1236 See supra note 1217. in the Proposing Release that limited assurance is not possible unless the assurance provider also believes reasonable assurance is possible on the subject matter. We expect that registrants’ ability to hire a non- accounting firm as a GHG emissions attestation provider and our decision to make certain modifications to the proposed requirements should help address concerns. The benefits of obtaining reasonable assurance are apparen t now and we do not expect those to change in the future. A number of commenters recommended that the Commission extend the phase in periods. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10 -Q. The final rules also extend the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emission disclosure to which it applies. The proposed rules would have required the attestation report to be included in the separately captioned “Climate- Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing. However, as discussed above, the final rules leave the placement of climate -related disclosures, other than the financial statement disclosures, largely up to each registrant. Proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHg emissions After the Compliance Date for GHG Emissions Disclosure but before the Compliance date for Assurance. We believe registrants would be better served by such flexibility. We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. We. believe that the requirements we have included in the final rules will help ensure that GHG. emissions attestation providers have sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute the. attestatio n engagement. In addition, non- CPAs are not able to use the AICPA or PCAOB attestation standards. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirement for a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with respect to the registrant and any of its affiliates. We view the independence requirements in the two contexts as providing similar, if not equivalent, protections to investors. The final rules model the factors the Commission will consider in determining whether a GHG emi ssions attestation provider is independent. The phased in compliance period will give registrants adequate time to find a provider that meets the independence requirements. The staff of the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants or GHG emissions attestation providers. The likelihood of this scenario is reduced by the multiyear phase in compliance period we are adopting. The exemption from the GHG emissions reporting and assurance requirements for SRCs and EGCs provides most new ly public companies with time to develop any in- house expertise that may be necessary. It is possible that the application of the independence requirements in the final rule s may result in a GHG emissions attestation provider no longer being able to provide certain non- assurance services to its assurance client. IESBA stated that it “holds to the premise that sustainability assurance engagements... must be underpinned by the same high standards of ethical behavior and independence.” The Commission is amending Rule 436 to provide that a report by a n attestation provider covering Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statement s made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level. We remind registrants and providers that there are other remedies available to shareholders and /or the Commission. Proposed rules would have required the attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be included in the separately- captioned “ Climate -Related Disclosure” section in the relevant filing. The Commission explained that the proposed requirement that the standards be established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures. The Commission is adopting the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report requirements with some modifications from the proposal. The final rules provide that the attestation report must be provided pursuant to standards that 1462 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; Futurepast; and Mazars. The propos ed rules also would have required the attested standards to be publicly available at no cost. In addition, it is important to recognize the value that investors have found in the voluntary assurance services currently being provided. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to use assurance standards they are already using for their voluntary disclosures.  ISO standards are widely used for GHG emissions assurance. We do not mean to imply that other standards, either those currently in existence, or those that may develop in the future, would not be suitable for use under the final rules. The Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants about whether a particular standard meets the rules. 1492 Therefore, the benefit of including the proposed minimum requirements would be marginal, at best, and could be viewed as redundant. 1493 We decided against including any additional requirements for the same reason. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be “suitable” Final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505, we agree with the commenters that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia’ The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant’s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal. The decision not to adopt a requirement for a. registrant to disclose whether its GHG. emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will. eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required. Final rules require disclosure of “any” oversight inspection program that applies to the GHG emissions attestation provider. The AICPA’s peer review program and PCAOB”s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs. We considered whether to only require disclosure about the existence of oversight inspections programs from registrants who engage GHG emission attestation providers that are not registered. See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement Inspection Process —Preliminary Evidence, 93Acct. Rev. 53, 53-80 (2018) We are concerned that requiring this disclosure only with respect to certain GHG emission attestation providers could result in confusion. Final rules will require an AF or LAF subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose whether its former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned or was dismissed and the date thereof. If so, the regis trant must state whether during the performance of the attestation engagement there were any disagreements. The final rules also include two instructions defining the term “disagreements” for purposes of the disclosure. The Commission proposed to require a registrant that was not required to include a GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed rules to disclose certain information. The final rules will not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions from any registrant. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures, the Commission is adopting a provision stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) constitute “forward -looking statements” T o the extent that disclosures made in response to these Items or to. any other s ubpart 1500 provision contain one or more of the following statements, they w ill fall. within the PSLRA statutory definition of “forward- looking statement ”. For example, a. projection or estimate of a registrant’s future GHG emissions made pursuant to. Item 1504 would likely constitute a forward-looking statement. The PSLRA safe harbors do not apply to statements made in connection with an IPO, or related to the operations of a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program. The Commission recently amended Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b- 2 to define “blank check company” as a company that has no specific business plan or purpose. See Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and Projections. We have determined that it is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors to extend the safe harbor to these entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies. Extending the PSLRA safe Harbor to these specified disclosures will encourage more comprehensive disclosures under these Items. We are not using our exemptive authority to extend. the safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities. Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s. ection 21E(b). (ii) forward looking -statements contained in. a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company. The final rules’ safe harbor will not be available for forward -looking statements included in a registrant’s consolidated financial statements. The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to provide a safe harbor from private litigation for such disclosures. The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: Financial Impact Metrics, Expenditure Metrics and Financial Estimates and Assumptions. Proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided additional transparency for investors. Proposed Expenditure Metrics referred to the positive and negative impacts associated with severe weather events, other natural condi tions, and climate-related activities. Commission also considered comments with respect to the proposed Expenditures Metrics. Proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions. Proposed Financial Impact Metrics focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s) The number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of income statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the final rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement effects. The proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to “mitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions” effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions have on a registrant’s financial statements. Only those line items that reflect capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses fall within the scope of the disclosures. We do not expect that gross revenues would be impacted under the final rules. Final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks in the financial statements. Final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrant to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances. Instead, disclosure is required if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve disclosed climate -related targets or goals. Registrants are also required to disclose where on the income statement or balance sheet the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs are presented. Reform, Sunrise Project et al. ; and Deloitte & Touche. See also letter from Travelers (Mar. 10, 2023) (objecting to the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the impact of any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rule) The final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the absolute values of the relevant denominator. The balances for these line items may represent debit or credit balances (which are not inherently either positive or negative) in the books and records. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose the capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events. Under the final rule s, registrants for which one percent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is less than $100,000 will not have to provide disclosure until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions. There is precedent in Regulation S -X for using $ 100,000 as a de minimis threshold. Final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules —stockholders’ equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit — are aggregated amounts. Some commenters raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures. 2061 See supra note 1817. 2062 See, e.g., letters from BHP and Ernst & Young LLP. 2063 We have considered the feedback we received from commenters urging the Commission to forgo the one percent disclosure threshold. 2064 We agree that the concept of materiality plays an important role in the F ederal securities laws. U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards do not refer explicitly to climate - related matters, but registrants have an obligation to consider material impacts. The final rules ( Rule 14-02(g) require a registrant to attribute a cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event. Second, the “significant contributing factor” principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor. Third, specifying an attribution and quantification principle in the final rules will reduce the burden associated with attributing and quantifying costs and expenditures. The final rules do not prescribe how a registrant must account for insurance proceeds in its financial statements. The final rules require a registrants to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed. A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of “severe weather events.” Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500. The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as “chronic risks.” These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to regulation S -K. The final rules require registrants to disclose expenditures for specific transactions that are recorded in a registrant’s books and records during the fiscal year. The final rules provide a level of fl exibility that even a regularly updated, prescribed list of events would be unable to match. The acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs do not present the definitional or scoping concerns raised by commenters. Proposed Rule 14- 02(f), which would have require d the disclosure of expenditures related to transition activities. This commenter was referring generally to the Commission’s proposal to amend both Regulation S -K and Regulation S-X. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose where on the balance sheet and income statement these capitalized costs, expenditures expense d, and losses are presented. Final rules require disclosure of the amount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe weather events. In May 2022, the FASB added a project to its technical agenda on regulatory credits (such as carbon offsets and RECs among others) Assume a registrant capitalized $1,200,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event A. The registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate -related target or goal. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, and therefore disclosure would be required. The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events. The final rules require the disclosure of expenditures expensed and losses “ as incurred. transition plans disclosed by t he registrant. 2168 To reduce the potential burden on registrants, we have decided to narrow the scope of transition activities covered by this aspect of the final rule. 2169 Consistent with the 2164 See letter from BHP. 2165 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). 2166 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. Final rules will require registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed targets and transition plans. The final rules will provide investors with more decision-useful information about the estimates and assumption used to prepare the financial statements than is required under accounting standa rds. Final rules focused on discrete transactions that are currently recognized in a registrant’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Current requirements under GAAP would continue to apply to material changes in estimates and assumptions. Final rules will not af fect existing filing obligations under Form 6 -K. The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed rules related to the disclosure of opportunities. The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of costs and expenditures to “mitigate the risks from seve re weather events and other natural conditions.” We do not expect that registrants will commonly incur costs, expenditures, charges, and losses as a result of severe weather event s or othernatural conditions in furtherance of an opportunity. The Commission is not adopting the proposed rules related to the voluntary disclosure in the financial statements of the impact o f any opportunities related to financial estimates and assumptions. The approach we are taking in the final rules will mitigate many of the concerns that commenters raised about the disclosure of opportunities. The final rules do not distinguish between “risks ” and “opportunities ” Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, we are adopting the requirement ( Rule 14-02(a) to provide contextual information with certain clarifying modifications. We have decided to include in the text of the final rules two additional types of contextual information a registrant is required to disclose. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects. We disagree with the commenters who stated that requiring disclosure of contextual information would result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is not useful for investors. The final rule s intentionally provide flexibility to registrants to allow them to include contextual information. This will enable investors to compare judgments and assumptions made by registrants, including across industries. We are not aware of any cirstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP. The Commission did not propose such requirements and —although we do not necessarily agree with those commenters that stated requiring disclosure at a segment or geographic level would be too complex or result in the disclosure of irrelevant information. We think the approach to disclosure we are adopting strikes an appropriate balance between providing consistent, comparable, and decision- useful information to investors and the associated burdens to registrants. financial statement note as part of the audited financial statement s will allow the disclosures to be readily incorporated into the scope of the financial statement and ICFR audit s that registrants currently obtain. Several commenters raised concerns about how auditors would address the one percent disclosure threshold when considering materiality in planning and perfor ming an audit. incorporated into the scope of registrants’ current financial statement and internal controls audit and therefore PCAOB -registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient, appropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law. 2366 See 15 U.S.C. 7212 (“It shall be unlawful for any person that is not a registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue, or to participate in, any audit report”). Final rules focus on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants’ books and records and material financial estimates and assumptions. Final rules avoid many of the complexities associated with the proposed rules. We do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures.315 The final rules, by contrast, are responsive to investors’ need for decision -related risk disclosure, and we have used the proposed rule to describe registrant’s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required.317 We have used the proposed rule to describe registrant’s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required. Furthermore, adopting a climate -related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions (set forth below in Item 1500) and is based on the climate -related disclosure framework of the TCFD, with which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardiz ing climate -related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful information for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already providing some climate -related disclosure based on the TCFD framework. 326 As discussed in more detail in section II.K.3.c.v, although Article 14 of Regulation S -X req uires a registrant to disclose certain financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which may include weather events that are not climate- related, subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K does not require the disclosure of material impact s from non -climate -related weather events. T he final rules provide that a registrant that has identified a climate -related risk pursuant to Item 1502 must disclose whether the risk is a physical or transition risk, providing information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presente d and the extent of the registrant’s exposure to the risk.334 The final rules then provide a non- exclusive list of disclosure s that a registrant must disclose as applicable: • If a physical risk, whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk, and the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk;335 and • If a transition risk, whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and in vestor preferences), or other transition - related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.336 333 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. In such instances, the Commission indicated that a registrant should provi de a clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk, as well as how those risks have evolved or are expected to evolve over time.341 The final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature For example, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk, and to provide the accompanying IP code or other subnational postal zone.345 The final rules we are adopting no longer require such disclosure and instead include, as one of the physical risk items that a registrant must disclose, as applicable, the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the identified physical risk.346 This revision is intended to address the concern of many commenters that the proposed ZIP code disclosure requirement would be burdensome to produce and would likely not provide useful information for many investors.350 This revision will give registrant s the flexibility to determine the granularity of any location disclosure s based on their particular facts and circumstances as long as they provide information necessary to understand the extent of water -related risks (the registrant’s exposure to such risks will be disclosed subject to a prescriptive approach ). This change was made in order to conform more closely to the definition of “transition risks” in Item 1500, which refers to “regulatoryity, technological, and market changes.” Although this definition refers to impacts to a registrant’s liability or reputation as non -exclusive examples of negative impacts resulting from such changes, the definition of transition risks also refers to other examples of negative impacts that are not specifically mentioned in Item 1502(a)(2). The proposed rule provisions pertaining to governance, strategy, and risk management would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to describe any climate -related opportunities it was pursuing when responding to those provisions.354 In this regard, the Commission proposed a definition of “climate -related opportunities” that was similar to the corresponding TCFD opportunity definition provided by the Commission. 378 Discussion In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact, a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters.375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long- term (i.e., 371 See, e.g. 438, 449 (1977) to further explain that an omitted fact is material if there is “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of info rmation made available.”). The “reasonably likely” component of the rules we are adopting, as with the same standard in MD&A regarding known trends, events, and uncertainties, is grounded in whether disclosure of the climate -related risk would be material to investors and requires that management evaluate the consequences of the risk as it would any known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Final Rules The final rule provision (Item 1502(b)) will require a registrant to d escribe the actual and potential material impacts of any climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) on the registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook.422 Information about the actual and potential material impacts of climate -related risks on a registrant’s strategy, business model, and outlook is central to understanding the extent to which a registrant’s business strategy or business model has changed, is changing, or is expected to change to address those impacts. For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term “outlook” is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or or forecasts in response to Item 1502(b). We have revised one of the types of potential material impacts listed in the proposal that referenced “suppliers and other parties in [ a registrant’s ] value chain, ” by replacing this phrase with “[s]uppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available.” This revision is intended to address the concern of some commenters that requiring a registrant to include material impacts to a registrant’s value chain would be overly burdensome to both the registrant and to entities in the registrant’s value chain. 430 Thus the final rule limits the scope of this specific topic to include only material impacts to the registrant’s suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts and further limits the information that should be disclosed about those impacts to information that is known or is reasonably available.431 The adopted provision is consistent with the Commission’s general rul es regarding the disclosure of information that is difficult to obtain, which will apply to the final rules if their conditions are met.432 Accordingly, as modified, this provision will help limit the compliance burden of the final rules by eliminating any potential need for registrants to undertake unreasonable searches or requests for information from their value chains. Under the final rules, as part of its targets and goals disclosure,441 a registrant will be required to provide disclosure concerning its use of ca rbon offsets or RECs if they constitute a material component of a registrant’s plan to achieve its climate -related targets or goals.442 Given this targets and goals disclosure require ment, explicitly requiring disclosure concerning the use of carbon offsets and RECs in the context of Item 1502(c ) is not necessary. We acknowledge the commenter who recommended that we delete the term “business model” in the proposed disclosure item;443 however, w e have retained the use of th is term in the final rule because requiring a registrant to disclose a material impact on its business model caused by a climate -related risk will provide important information to investors about the effectiveness of the registrant’s climate -related risk management that would otherwise be lost were we to omit this reference. This will not only provide investors with important information about a registrant ’s strategic decision -making concerning a material climate -related risk but should also help the registrant determine whether there are material expenditures that must be disclosed, thereby lower ing the compliance burden, as some commenters noted.452 This disclosure requirement is intended to capture actual material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year for the purpose of climate -related risk mitigation or adaptation. As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant’s climate -related goals as part of a registrant’s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. Although similar co ncerns could arise with respect to Item 1502(d) ’s expenditures disclosure requirement, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright -line threshold, as was proposed for th e Regulation S -X amendments, and limiting the disclosure to material expenditures that, in “management’s assessment, ” are the direct result of mitigation or adaptation activities, will help to mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns. In addition, in responding to the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the expenditure and how management has determined that it is a direct result of the disclosed transition activities, which may help alleviate concerns about potential liability exposure for attribution decisions.460 Requiring the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, from management’s assessment, directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will also provide investors with important information that will help them understand a registrant ’s transition strategy. 492 Another commenter stated that, due to the long timeline of transition plans, annual progress updates w ould in many cases not provide meaningful information for investors.493 This comm enter rule recommended that there should instead be a requirement to annually report any actions taken to achieve transition plans that are material to the registrant, as well as any material positive or negative deviations from the plan or changes to it that a re material to the registrant. 494 Another commenter stated that a registrant should have to update its transition plan disclosure only when the registrant believes it is appropriate to do so, and such updating should occur at most on an annual basis.495 c. Final rule After consider ing comments received, we are adopting, with modifications from the proposal, a final rule provision (Item 1502(e)) that will requir e a registrant to describe a transition plan i f it has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk.496 Like the rule proposal, the final rules define (in Item 1500) a “transition plan” to mean a registrant’s strategy 490 See, e.g. transition plan disclosure will have the flexibility to provide disclosure that addresses the particular facts and circumstances of its material transition risk.506 We also note that, as with scenario analysis and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant’s transition plan disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor. 507 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires a registrant to update its annual report disclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing any actions taken during the year under the plan, including how s uch actions have impacted the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition. 516508 This updating requirement will help investors understand the registrant’s progress under the plan over time, track the impacts of a transition plan on a registrant’s business and, as noted by commenters, help inform investment decisions. In a modification of the proposed rule, which would have generally required the disclosure of the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage transition risk under a transition plan, the final rule will require a registrant, as part of its updating disclosure, to i nclude quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates a nd assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions taken under the plan.517 While this provision is similar to Item 1502(d), Item 1502(e) differs in that it is intended to elicit disclosure about material expenditures and material impacts on financ ial estimates and assumptions that directly result from actions taken under a transition plan (e.g., material expenditures made for climate- related research and development ). As recommended by one commenter,523 we have removed the reference to physical ris ks that was in the proposed rule.524 This change will make the transition plan disclosure requirement more consistent with disclosure that are based on the TCFD’s recommendation s,525 which may mitigate the costs and complexity of complying with t he final rule for registrants already familiar with the TCFD’s framework.526 A registrant that faces a material physical risk, however, will still be required to disclose how it is managing that risk as part of its risk management disclosure.527 These revisions will elicit material information for 521 We remind registrants that while they are permitted to cross -reference to information in their financial statement s to satisfy t heir Regulation S -K disclosure obligations, they are not permitted to cross -reference to Regulation S -K disclosures in their financial statements, unless otherwise specifically permitted or required by the Commission’s rules or by U.S. underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis disclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board as part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.557 Some commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly available scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), or the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), to enhance the comparability of the scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each registrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its disclosure accordingly.559 c. The disclosure of a registrant’s use of scenario analysis can provide important forward -looking information to help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant’s strategy under various climate -related circumstances.560 Scenario analysis has increasingly been recognized as an important analytical tool in assessing a company’s climate -related risk. would be burdensome and costly to produce.564 We also note that, as with transition plan and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant’s scenario analysis disclosure disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor.565 The final rule provides that, if a registrant uses scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate -related risks on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, and i f, based on the results of scenario analysis, a r egistrant determines that a climate -related risk is reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, then the registrant must describe each such scenario,567 including a brief description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used, as well as the expected material impacts, including financial impacts, on the registrant under each such scenario.568 We are adopting this disclosure requirement because, if a registrant has used scenario analysis to assess and manage a material climate- related risk, investors need to understand how it conducted that analysis in order to evaluate the registrant’s conclusions regarding material impacts on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. By requiring disclosure based on whether a registrant has determined to conduct scenario analysis as part of its consideration of material climate -related risks, a registrant will be able to select the climate scenario model or models that it believes best fits its particular industry or business, or its climate risk assessment approach. To further streamline the scenario analysis disclosure requirement, we have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information.575 We recognize that, as noted by some commenters, scenario analysis practices are still evolving,576 and that, in the early stages of use, a registrant’s disclosure regarding its use of scenario analysis may be qualitative. As a registrant’s use of scenario analysis becomes more sophisticated, we would expect its disclosure of the results of scenario analysis to become more quantitative, particularly when discussing the expec ted material financial impacts on the registrant’s business strategy, under each considered scenario, which, like the proposed rule, must be addressed should a registrant be required to disclose its use of scenario analysis. At the same time, we recognize commenters’ concern that, without a materiality qualifier, the proposed rule could have result ed in the disclosure of internal carbon pricing data that would require registrants to disclose more information about the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing, including the scope of the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing and the impact of such use on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is likely to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate- related risk when responding to other final rule provisions, such as when describing a related transition plan, 229617 even if the description of internal carbon pricing is less detailed because it is part of a broader narrative discussion. have eliminated from the final rule the proposed requirement s to disclose the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.618 By streamlining the internal carbon price disclosure requirement in this way and adding materiality qualifiers, the final rules will help ensure that investors receive material disclosure about the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing to inform their investment and voting decisions while limiting the compliance burden for registrant s. 620 Because of these changes to the proposed rule, we believe that it is unnecessary to adopt an exemption or excep tion to the internal carbon price disclosure requirement, as some commenters recommended,621 or a separate phase in for the disclosure requirement, as recommended by other commenters.622 618 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. Specifically, we are eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose: • The identi ty of specific board members responsible for climate -related oversight; • Whether any board member has expertise in climate- related risks and the nature of the expertise; • How frequently the board is informed of such risks ; and • Information regarding whether and how the board sets climate -related targets or goals, including interim targets or goals. While the proposal would have required this disclosure only to the extent applicable, we appreciate the concerns of some commenters who stated that these elements of the proposal could have unintended effects on the board’s governance structure and processes by focusing on one area of ris k that is disclosed 669 or influence the board’s transition process by focusing on one area of ris k that is disclosed 669. If a board of directors determines to oversee a particular risk, the fact of such ove rsight being exercised by the board is likely material to investors given other demands on the board’s time and attention.672 Moreover, unlike management, which likely oversees climate -related positions or expertise, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to investors, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to the company and limited in number. The final rule requires registrants to disclose information about their management oversight of climate -related risks, except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant’s principal line of business.708 c. The final rule requires registrants to disclose information about their management oversight of climate -related risks, except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant’s principal line of business.708 c. However, consistent with our overall goal to streamline the proposed requirements and to focus on management’s over sight of material climate -related risk, we are not including such additional disclosure elements in the final rule.710 We are adopting the proposal requir ing a description of the relevant expertise of position holders or members responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risk.711 While we considered the view of commenters that this could cause registrants t o feel compelled to find and hire management with such expertise, regardless of whether that is the most sensible use of managerial resources given the registrant’s particular climate -related facts and circumstances, the added qualification that disclosure is only required where the risk is material. , letter from Chamber (“ We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk., letter from Chamber (“ We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk. While supra registrants may be required to disclose certain climate -related information in filings made with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure requirements, as noted above 730 there is a need to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of disclosures about c limate -related risk management for investors given that, as noted above, most r egistrants are not currently including the type of information called for by the final rules in voluntary climate reports or Exchange Act filings.770 We also considered comments that the proposal placed undue emphasis on climate -related risks and, as discussed below, have made a number of changes in response to streamline the requirements and focus on materia l climate - related risks. The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks.773 The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks. In addition, because the processes and factors that a registrant may use to identify the two types of risks may differ in certain respects, or in some cases a registrant may face one and not the other kind of risk, this change should elicit more relevant information for investors.775 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule also provides that a registrant should address, as applicable, how it: • Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk;776 and • 785s whether to address the climate -related risk.777 The final rules will help investors to understand the processes that a registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing climate -related risks, consistent with the feedback of many commenters.778 In this regard, commenters further indicated that information concerning how a registrant prioritizes climate -related risks vis --vis other risks that the registrant is managing would be particularly useful.779 We are not, however, retaining the proposed requirement to disclose how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high priority risks.787 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b), and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant’s climate -related targets or goals in order to understand and assess the registrant ’s transition risk strategy and how the registrant is manag ing the material impacts of its identified climate -related risks. We recognize, however, as some commenters indicated, that an overly broad requirement to disclose any climate -related target or goal, even one that is meant for preliminary, internal planning purposes and that is not yet material, could impose a compliance burden on registrants that may outweigh its benefi t to investors.848 Conditioning the targets and goals disclosure requirement on the target s or goal s being material will help to address this concern by focusing the requirement on the information that is most likely to be decision- useful for investors. 856 See Proposing the proposed rule requires commenters s ection to meet its climate -related targets or goals.857 See Proposing the proposed rule requires commenters s ection to meet its climate -related targets or goals.853 These disclosures will allow investors to better understand a registrant s targets or goals and how it intends to achieve them, which will help investors better assess a registrant’s transition risks and make more informed investment and voting decisions. 859 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule (Item 1504(c)) will require a registrant to disclose any progress toward meeting the target or goal and how such progress has been achieved.860 Also similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will req uire the registrant to update this disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or goals. Relatedly, the final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal.863 This disc ussion must include quantitative and qualitative 859 See letter from Unilever. A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of climate -related offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the extent to which the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets or RECs ; the nature of the offsets or RECs ; and the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. 878 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812. Relatedly, a registrant that relies on carbon offsets or RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve its targets or goals might need to consider whether fluctuating supply or demand, and corresponding variability of price, related to c arbon offsets or RECs, pr esents an additional material risk that is required to be disclosed when discussing its plan to achieve such target or goal pursuant the requirements of subpart 1500. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant’s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant’s business and financial condition. 891 The Commission also proposed to require a registrant to disclose its Scope 2 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or 888 We proposed to define “greenhouse gases” as carbon dioxide (“CO 2”); methane (“CH 4”); nitrous oxide (“N 2O”); nitrogen trifluoride (“NF 3”); hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”); perfluorocarbons (“PFCs”); and sulfur hexafluoride (“SF 6”). the Exchange Act annual report.1001 Commenters recommended varying GHG emissions disclosure deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10-Q.100 Commenters recommended varying GHG emissions disclosure deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10-Q. We recognize commenters’ concerns about the potentially high cost of compliance associated with the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement, including Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1009 as well as concerns about th e current availability and reliability of the underlying data for Scope 3 emissions.1010 To help address these concerns, instead of requiring, as proposed, the disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by all registrants regardless of their materiality, the final rules will require the disclosure of Scope 1 emissions and /or Scope 2 em issions metrics1011 by LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs, on a phased in basis,1012 if such emissions are material.1013 1008 See, e.g. 1017 If a registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than a n SRC or EGC and its Scope 1 emissions are material but its Scope 2 emissions are not material, then, under the final rules, the registrant must disclose its Scope 1 emissions and is not required to disclose its Scope 2 emissions (and vice versa if its Scope 2 emissions are material but its Scope 1 emissions are not). A registrant’s Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions may be material because the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to allow investors to understand whether those emissions are significant enough to subject the registrant to a transition risk that will or is reasonably likely to materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition in the short - or long- term. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources and time to prepare for what we acknowledge could be a significant additional compliance obligation.1024 We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. Nevertheless, mindful of the attendant costs, we believe that the final rules present an appropriate means to achieve the primary benefits of GHG emissions disclosure, namely: providing investors with material metrics that will aid in the assessment of transition risk for those registrants that have identified a material climate risk ; and facilitating investors ’ evaluation of a registrant’s progress towards achieving a material target or goal and the attendant effects on the registrant’s business, resul ts of operations, or financial condition. While the final GHG emissions disclosure provision will not apply to as many registrants or achieve the same level of comparability as may have been achieved under the proposed rules, on balance, we believe that, coupled with the other disclosures required under subpart 1500 and the structured data requirements of the final rules, investors will have sufficient information to assess the operational and financial impact of transition risks and strategies on registrants and compare such impacts across registrants. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure (120:1197 Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Disclosure Compliance Date Limited Assurance Compliance Date Reasonable Assurance Compliance Date LAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033 AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs) Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A AFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report under the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1) (i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. We considered the view expressed by some commenters that there is no reason to treat GHG emissions disclosures differently than other disclosures located outs ide of the financial statements, which do not require assurance.1210 Although we recognize that registrants may provide quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements that is not subject to any assurance requirement, a s explained in the Proposi ng Release,1211 and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters,1212 GHG emissions disclosures are unique in that many companies currently voluntarily seek third- party assurance over their climate- related disclosures, and commenters, including investor s, have expressed a particular need for assurance over GHG 1207 See, e.g. See Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance), available at https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_1222.01.0015.01.ENG (requiring companies within its jurisdiction to obtain limited assurance over sustainability reporting and sta ting that the European Commission will perform an assessment to determine if moving from limited to reasonable assurance is feasible for both auditors and companies); SB -253, Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (Oct. 1225 However, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules will exempt SRC s and EGCs from the requirement to obtain an attestation report.1226 Although some commenters urged the Commission to apply the final rules to all registrants,1227 not just AFs and LAFs, our decision to exempt SRCs and EGCs from the assurance requirement is d riven by our decision to exempt these companies from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions, which is discussed in greater detail above. Under the final rules, AFs and LAFs will be required to obtain limited assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505 (the GHG emissions disclosure provision). For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance engagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the engagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. 1244 We agree with commenters that extending the phase in periods would provide registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers with additional time to prepare for implementation of the rules and would allow assurance standards and practices applicable to 1243 See supra note 1193; Brandon Gipper, et al. See also letters from GRI (“Reasonable assurance should be adopted as this would be commensurate with the level of assurance provided through statutory audits of financial statements and will give information users increased confidence that t he reported information is prepared in accordance with stated criteria.”); and PWYP (“Given the importance of GHG emissions data to enable investors to fully understand the climate -related risks of issuers, reasonable assurance is necessary to ensure that information is subjected to sufficient examination and verification such that it can be relied on by investors.”). As discussed above, the final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates, or may be included in an amended annual report on Form 10- K no later than the due date for such Form 10- Q.1255 The extension of the deadline for the filing of GHG emissions metrics assurance also applies to the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emissions disclosure to which the report applies.1256 This additional time —an additional two fiscal q uarters —should provide registrants subject to Item 1505 and their GHG emissions attestation providers with sufficient time to measure GHG emissions, provide assurance, and prepare the required attestation report. Consistent with the notice requirements in cluded in Item 1505(c), the final rules (Item 1506(f)) provide that a registrant that elects to incorporate by reference its attestation report from its Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter or to provide its attestation report in an amended annual repor t must include an express statement in its annual Such filer would be required to follow the requirements of Item s 1506(b) through (d), including using the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, which was supported by one commenter.1264 Although in the Proposing Release, the requirements outlined in this paragraph would have applied to any climate -related disclosures not subject to assurance under Item 1506(a),1265 we have narrowed the scope of the final rule to apply only to GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured under Item 1506(a) because, given the requirement in t he final rule material, we think it is unlikely that registrants will voluntarily obtain assurance over non -GHG emissions disclosure for which the disclosure required by 1506(e) would be useful to investors. 1359 We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. See 1592 See supra notes 1300 and 1301 and accompanying text. 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). In this regard, we note that the IAASB and ISO standards, two of the four standards we are explic itly permitting assurance providers to use under the final rules (as discussed in more detail below), are not restricted to CPAs, and we are not aware that any state laws are currently impacting the ability of non -CPA service providers to provide assurance over GHG emissions. 1369 Namely, the final rules provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all iss ues encompassed within the attestation provider’s engagement, which is modeled on Rule 2- 01(b). However, we agree that the proposed rule would not prohibit the disclosure of the registrant’s independence information with respect to the accompanying auditor’s fees, including the disclosure of the registrant’s GHG emissions data from the accompanying attestation provider.1370 Along those lines, existing Commission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2- 01 do not apply to the independence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or interpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly p resented under Item 1506 (which is a possibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2- 01), the guidance or interpretation would be a useful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371 We considered the concern raised by commenters tha t requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially increase costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant’s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). For example, with respect to its mining disclosure rules, the Commission stated that it was not adopting a requirement for a qualified person to be independent from the registrant because, among other thi ngs, the final rules require a registrant to disclose the qualified person’s affiliated status with the registrant or another entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, which is consistent with its mining guidelines. practice among some registrants of obtaining third -party assurance over their GHG emissions data.1381 Although generally the independence requirements in the assurance standards currently being used with respect to GHG emissions data are not as robust as the requirements in the final rules, many of these standards include requirements related to the objectivity and impartiality of the third -party assurance provider.1382 Therefore, the final rules’ independence requirement is not inconsistent with the general practice in this space of retaining an objective and impartial third -party to provide assurance.1383 In addition, we are adopting the definition of “affiliate” as p roposed and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters that addressed this issue.1384 Similarly, we are adopting the broad definition of “a ttestation and professional engagement period” as proposed, which is modeled on the definition of “audit and professional engagement standards” in Rule 2 -01.1385 As discussed in greater detail above, in response to a request for comment, some commenters recommended that the Commission require the GHG emissions attestation provider 1381 See supra note 1232. Although the final rules do not include a requirement that a registrant’s audit committee pre-approve the GHG emissions attestation services, nor was such a requirement proposed, it would be permissible under the final rules for a registrant to use the auditor of its financial statements to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagement, assuming the final rules’ requirements for assurance providers are met. See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant’s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagements for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered “Audit -Related Fees” for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -A, Item 14 of Form 10 -B, Item 14 of Form 10 -C, Item 14 of Form 10 -D, Item 14 of Form 10 -F, Item 14 of Form 10 -G, Item 14 of Form 10 -H, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -J, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -L, Item 14 of Form 10 -M, Item 14 of Form 10 Although not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their incentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would result in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential downsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted above,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment of an accountant’s report on unaudited interim financial statements included in a registration statement, which is also provided at the limited assurance level. 1399 However, we think it is nonetheless important that a GHG emissions attestation provider have some awareness about whether its attestation report is included in a 1397 In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers which are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level. Further, to help facilitate registrants’ compliance with the requirement to file the letter from the GHG emissions attestation provider as an exhibit, we have included an instruction to Item 1506 that directs registrants obtaining assurance at a limited assurance level to Item 601(b)(27) ( as well as to paragraph 18 of Form 20- F’s Instructions as to Exhibits, as discussed infra note 1402 and accompanying text ). included in a registration statement.1403 We also note, as discussed above, that certain commenters stated that deeming the information expertized may have the effect of deterring or reducing available assurance providers.1404 We believe the approach we have taken appropriately addresses these co ncerns by exempting the GHG emissions attestation providers that perform limited assurance engagements from section 11 liability and the consent requirements associated with expertized reports, and requiring consent with corresponding section 11 liability only when the heightened level of review associated with reasonable assurance makes it appropriate for the report to be expertized. This bifurcated approach to reasonable versus limited assurance engagements is consistent with the current treatment of audited financial statements and unaudited (reviewed) interim financial statements.1405 While we recognize underwriters and other non- issuer defendants subject to potential liability under section 11 may face additional due diligence requirements during the transition 1471 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the “framework on which management’s evaluation of the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment”)). 1475 This approach will not only reduce the costs of complying with the final rules1476 but will likely b enefit investors by leveraging the experience that GHG emissions attestation providers already have with particular standards, which could lead to assurance engagements being performed with a greater level of skill initially than if GHG emissions attestation providers were required to gain expertise with an unfamiliar standard. 1478 The ISO TC 207/SC7 is the technical committee responsible for the development of ISO 14064- 3 – Greenhouse gases – Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of greenhouse gas s tatements.1479 The committee includes members from 120 countries, each represented by the country’s national standards body, and the committee also includes representatives from 32 organizations who monitor standards development activities and can provide input during standards development. 1488 The final rules (Item 1506(c)) require the form and content of the GHG emissions attestation report to follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards used, as proposed; however, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules do not prescribe minimum report requirements. 1489 The Commission expla ined in the Proposing Release that the proposed minimum components were all common elements of current assurance reports,1490 a point that was affirmed in the feedback we received from commenters.1491 We continue to expect that the attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules will generally 1486 See supra note 1430 and accompanying text. To the extent the AF or LAF disclosed Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for a historical period, it would not be required to obtain an assurance report covering such historical period in the first year of the attestation rule’s applicability. 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criteria” against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol’s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia” against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1505 This commenter asked the Commission to clarify whether, to the extent the Commission permits the use of standards other than those developed by the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB, the Commission should clarify “whether all practitioners should be required to consider ‘other information’ in the same way as registrants.” 1503 The GHG emissions attestation provider must perform the engagement in accordance with t he requirements included in the attestation standard being used. Accordingly, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to disclose certain information when there is a change in, and disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider as discussed in greater detail below.1543 The decision not to adopt a requirement for a registrant to disclose whether its GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required, thus re ducing the burden associated with the final rules. The AICPA’s peer review program and PCAOB’s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs that a GHG emissions attestation provider may be subject to generally; however, only the AICPA’s peer review program would include within its scope the GHG emissions attestation engagement. As stated above, the Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing Release asking if it should require disclosure when there is a change in, or disagreement with, the registrant’s GHG emissions attestation provider that is similar to the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K.1558 The commenters that responded to the request for comment generally agreed with including such a requirement in the final rules.1559 Because we believe that requiring the disclosure of information regarding changes in, and disagreements with, a GHG emissions attestation provider would provide investors with important information about the provider and the conduct of the attestation engagement, which investors need to help them assess the reliability of the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures, we have included a provision in the final rules that will require AFs and LAFs subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose the extent to which the registrant’s former GHG emissions attestation provider resigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re -appointment after completion of the attestation engagement) or is dismissed. 1563 We have generally modeled this aspect of the final ru les on the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K, tailored to fit the context of 1566 This definition and explanation is consistent with Item 304 of Regulation S -K and its Instructions, with minor modifications to take into account the circumstances of a GHG emissions attestation engagement.1567 We have determined to take an incremental approach to requiring disclosure about the resignation or dismissal of a GHG emissions attestation provider and therefore have not included a requirement for the registrant to request the former GHG emissions attes tation provider to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the registrant with respect to the resignation or dismissal and disagreement (if applicable). The final rules, howeve r, do not preclude a registrant from disclosing its explanation of the dismissal or resignation to its former GHG emissions attestation provider, and although not required, we encourage any GHG emissions attestation provider to convey concerns it has with the registrant’s description of those events to the Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3C emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute “forward -looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : • 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); • 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); • 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and • 17 CFR 229.1504 (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro m CEMEX. For example, a statement of plans to transiti on to more efficient operations or a different mix of products or ser vices made in response to Item 1502( d), Item 1502( e), or Item 1504 (targets and goals) would likely constitute a forward- looking statement. For example, a statement of future economic performance made pursuant to Items 1502(d), Item 1504, or Item 303 of Regulation S -K would likely constitute a forward -looking statement. We also believe that a safe harbor for these disclosures wi ll help incentivize more comprehensive disclosures on these matters to the benefit of investors.1688 Statements made by i ssuers and /or in connection with transactions that will be eligible for the final rule s’ safe harbor include forward -looking statements that will be eligible for the final rule s’ safe harbor include forward -looking statements : made in connection with an offering of securities by a blank check company;1690 made with respect to the business or operations of an issuer of penny stock; made in connection with a rollup transaction; or made in connection with an IPO,1691 or in connection with an offering by, or relating to the operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program.1692 1688 See supra note 1640 and accompanying text. 1689 In addition to issuers, consistent with the PSLRA safe harbors, the safe harbor will apply to: a person acting on behalf of the issuer; an outside reviewer retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of the issuer; or an underwriter, with respect to information provided by the issuer or information derived from information provided by the issuer. We are not using our exemptive authority to extend the PSLRA safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(A) (specified “bad actors”); (ii) forward looking -statements contained in a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company as specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(B); and (iii) forward -looking statements made by an issuer in a going- private transaction, see section 27A(b)(1)(E) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(E), in connection with a tender offer, see Securities Act section 27A(b)(2)(C) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(C), or in a beneficial ownership report required to be filed pursuant to s ection 13(d) of the Exchange Act, see Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(F) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(F). Specifically, the Commission proposed that if a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by proposed s ubpart 1500 in a f iling that also requires audited financial statements, then the registrant would be required to disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated financial statement metrics.1704 The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: • Financial Impact Metrics;1705 • Expenditure Metrics; and • Financial Estimates and Assumptions.1706 The proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required disclosure of the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions and any efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on the line items in a registrant’s financial statement. 1941, and we expect registrants to be required to disclose the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions on the line items in a registrant’s financial statement. Moreover, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s,1942 the requirements we are adopting will provide many of the same benefits of transparency and insights that the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided, albeit without as much detail, which should reduce the burden on registrants. In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii, we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants ’ financial reporting obligations. Therefore, a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics.1946 Therefore, a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. The final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters. The proposed rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters. Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics only required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to the mitigation of risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions, the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions because tho se costs would have constituted line -item impacts to a registrant’s financial statements. In response to commenter requests for additional clarity,2001 we are prescribing an attribution principle that registrants must use to determine whether a capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss is “as a result of” a severe weather event or other natural condition.2002 The attribution principle will also simplify the determination of the amount required to be dis closed by eliminating the need to allocate portions of costs and expenditures, which will reduce compliance costs for registrants.2003 Under the final rules, t he requirement to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions remain s subject to a one percent disclosure threshold; however, we are modifying the denominators used for the threshold and adopting de minimis thresholds that exempt disclosure of amounts that aggregate to less than $100,000 in the income statement or less than $500,000 in the balance sheet, as explained in greater Although we are not adopting the broader requirement for di sclosure of transition activities in the financial statements, registrants will be required to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs in the financial statements.2011 The proposed rules identified the amount of expense d or capitalized 2008 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2014 Furthermore, although the final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise exposure to transition risks in the financial statements, the final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrants to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances as described in greater detail above,2015 which should result in the disclosure of some of the information for expenditures related to transition activities that we would have expected to be disclosed under the proposed rules, albeit outside of the financial statements. , ASC 230 Statement of Cash flows (requir ing classification of cash receipts and cash payments as resulting from operating, investing, and financing activities ); ASC 280 Segments (noting that a registrant “shall disclose both of the following about each reportable segment if the specified amounts ar e included in the determination of segment assets reviewed by the chief operating decision maker or are otherwise regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, even if not included in the determination of segment assets...(b) total expenditures for additions to long -lived assets...” ) (ASC 280-10-50-25); and ASC 730 Research and Development ( requir ing disclosure of the total research and development costs charged to expense in each period for which an income statement is presented) (ASC 730 -10-50-1). However, registrants may consider whether disaggregating material cash outflows to acquire property, plant, and equipment2020 purchased to meet the registrant’s transition plans, targets, or goals on the statement of cash flows or in a related note is appropriate to provide complete information about the entity’s cash flows for the period. Under the final rules, registrants are required to disclose the aggregate amount s of (1) carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) carbon offsets and RECs Proposed requirement or questioned what disclosure objective it was intended to achieve.2029 Because the final rules we are adopting are more narrowly focu sed on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, we do not think it would be in keeping with this approach to also require a registr ant to disclose the impacts from any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to Item 1502(a). See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2) Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision -useful disclosure information about registrants ’ capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. In a further shift from the propos al, we have included de minimis thresholds in the final rules.2047 As dis cussed above, some commenters expressed the view that the proposed one percent disclosure threshold would place an unreasonable burden on smaller companies because it is more likely that the impacts on smaller companies would exceed the one percent disclos ure threshold.2048 In addition, a few commenter s mentioned a de minimis exception in their letter s.2049 We recognize the possibility that a one percent disclosure threshold could be disproportionately burdensome for smaller companies or companies in the earl y stages of developing a product or business line for which one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit or stockholders’ equity or deficit could be a very small amount. As discussed in greater detail below, the final rules also include an attribution principle that limits the required disclos ure to circumstances where the severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant contributing factor in incurring the capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss.2054 The final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules —stockholders’ equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit — are aggregated amounts and therefore we expect that in many instances they will result in a larger denominator than what was included in the proposal. Some commenters also raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures relative to the impacts of other risks disclosed in the financial statement s or could suggest a level of precision that does not exist.2055 However, the final rules require disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges e, and l osses that are currently recorded in the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP, and therefore the disclosures should have the same degree of precision as the other information provided in the financial statements. , letters from BHP (“Further, while we acknowledge that the Commission currently uses a specific 1% threshold for certain disclosures, we note that the disclosure examples provided by the Commission are generally narrow in scope, factual in nature and limited to certain line items in the financial statements (for example, the amount of excise taxes included in revenue)”); Ernst & Young LLP (“But we note that, unlike the climate -related impacts, excise taxes are discrete event charges that are easily calculated and tracked in a registrants accounting books and records.”); and IADC (“The Commission argues that a 1% quantitative threshold is used in other contexts, but the examples the Commission cites are circumstances where the quantitative amounts involved are knowable under current accounting practice, have discrete impacts on specific financial line items, and address scenarios in which more detailed disclosure is appropriate. See also letter from CFA Institute (“We would also observe that existing U.S. See also letter from CFA Institute (“We would also observe that existing U.S. Second, the “significant contributing factor” principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor resulting in the registrant incurring the expenditure or re ceiving the recovery, while not requiring disclosure where a severe weather event or other natural condition w as only a minor factor, thereby reducing the cost burden on registrants. 2076 See, e.g., FASB ASC 210 Topic 280 Segment Reporting, FASB ASC 323 Equity Method and Joint Ventures, FASB ASC 810 Consolidations, and FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. However, the final rules require a registrant to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed by a registrant such as a discussion of the composition of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses.2083 Similar to the final rules’ other disclosure requirements, a registrant will be required to identify where the recoveries are presented in the income statement and the b alance sheet.2084 v. Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of “severe weather events and other natural conditions” under the final rules, which we acknowledge are not required to disclose a portion of the registrant’s natural condition risks (i.e. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining “physical risks” to include “acute risks” (including severe weather events) and “chronic risks”); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as examples of “chronic risks.” These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to Regulation S -K. We considered whether the non- exclusive list of examples should be expanded to include other types of severe weather events or other natural conditions identified by commenters in their comment letters;2095 however, we designed the list as non- exhaustive and non -exclusive because we thin k it is more appropriate to take a flexible approach to enable registrants to exercise judgment in identifying severe weather events or other natural conditions based on the impacts those events have on their financial condition. Some commenters asserted that allowing registrants to exercise judgment about which severe weather events or natural conditions to analyze would reduce comparability.2096 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant to every 2093 For exa mple, in determining whether high temperatures constitute a severe natural condition, a relevant factor may include average seasonal temperatures. to severe weather events and other natural conditions to carbon offsets and RECs, using the same trigger fo r disclosure in the amendments to Regulation S -K and the amendments to Regulation S - X will provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the registrant’s use of carbon offsets and RECs, which will help investors evaluate the role of these instrum ents in a registrant’s climate -related strategy and help them assess the likely financial effects of a disclosed material transition risk.2105 In addition, the final rules require registrants to disclose the beginning and ending balances of capitalized car bon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year.2106 The beginning and ending balances of carbon offsets and RECs are an important data point for investors to understand as they assess a registrant ’s transition risks. weather events and other natural conditions.2111 Under the final rules, registrants must separately aggregate the (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered and for purposes of disclosure.2112 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses must be segregated between the balance sheet and the income statement depending on which financial statement the y are recorded within the calendar year. The registrant would determine whether the financial statement effects as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the thresholds, as illustrated below: Expenditure Category Current Fiscal Year Balances (Stockholders’ Equity from Balance Sheet, Income or Loss Before Income Tax Expense or Benefit from Income Statement) Severe Weather Event A Natural Condition B Severe Weather Event C Percentage Impact Balance Sheet (capitalized costs and charges) $150,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,750,000 1.97% Income Statement (expenditures expensed as incurred and losses) $75,000,000 $750,000 $2,000,000 3.67% In the above example, the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event A was $1,200,000 (capitalized on balance sheet), the capitalized cost, charge, and loss incurred as a result of Natural Condition B was $1,750,000 (charge on balance sheet and loss in income statement of $750,00 and capitalized cost of $1,000,000 on the balance sheet), and the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event C was $2,000,000 (expense in the income statement). Similar to the examples of disclosure that were included in the proposed rules, t he final rules state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of expenditure s expensed and losses as incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, relocate assets or operations affected by the event or condition, retire affected assets, repair affected assets, recognize impairment loss of affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2 The final rules also state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, retire affected assets, replace or repair affected assets, recognize an impairment charge for affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2121 4. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and 2120 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c). The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. GAAP and IFRS require the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions in many circumstances,2181 including significant inputs associated with material estimates and assumptions, the final rules will enhance transparency and consistency by requiring registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed 2177 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. In addition, although we agree with commenters that the proposed requirements share similarities with critical accounting estimates,2182 we do not think those disclosures obviate the need for this requirement because the final rules go further by requiring specific disclosure about how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. Proposed Rule s The proposed rule s would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate -related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K, on any of the financial statement metrics.2188 The Proposing Release explained that if a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the impact of a climate -related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so consistently ( e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the 2185 See supra note 2157 and accompanying text. The requirement in the final rules to d is requiring capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed 2217 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3 (stating, in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics, that a registrant may choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities but remaining silent with respect to opportunities for costs and expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions). The requirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Proposed Rule s In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that because the proposed financial statement metrics would involve estimation uncertainties driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other financial statement disclosures, registrants would be required to disclose conte xual information to enable a reader to understand how it derived the financial statement metrics, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the metrics. On the other hand, commenters raised concerns that certain of the proposed financial statement metrics would not necessarily comport with GAAP, including amounts for lost revenues, cost savings, or cost reductions.2246 In addition, in response to a question in the Proposing Release, certain commenters stated that the proposed financial statement metrics should be calculated at a reportable segment level when a registrant has more than one reportable segment, as defined by FASB Topic 280. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects.2252 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting may involve estimation uncertaintytie s that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, like certain other financial statement disclosures, ASC 210,2253 and therefore disclosure of contextual information will facilitate investors’ understanding of the financial statement effects and will be an integral part of the financial statements. We have decided to include “significant judgments” as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures, and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures.2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions. We are also adopting the requirements ( Rule 14-01(c)) for registrants to calculate the financial statement effects using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the r egistrant’s consolidated financial statements and to apply the same set of accounting principles that a registrant is required to apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements, consistent with the proposal. 2262 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, requiring registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosures using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant’s consolidated financial statements w ill avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency, and aid comparability. 2263 In addition, we agree with the commenter who stated that applying the same set of accounting principles to the financial statement disclosures will aid comparability.2264 We are not aware of any cumstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP, and therefore we are striking the words “[w]henever applicable” from the final rules, in response to the commenter who stated that this phrase was confusing because it could i mply that 2262 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(c). We understand that a number of commenters raised concerns about applying PCAOB standards and stated that additional guidance would be needed.2359 The modifications made to the final rules to narrow their scope to capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses derived from transactions and amounts recorded in registrant’ s books and records underlying the financial statements and material ly impacted estimates and assumptions, along with the Commission’ s adoption of an attribution principle, will help to mitigate commenters’ concerns about the auditability of the disclosures. 2362 See supra notes 2306 and 2308 and accompanying text. However, PCAOB -registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient, appropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law.2366 Moreover, PCAOB - registered accounting firms are subject to periodic inspection by the PCAOB and are required to comply with PCAOB rules. 2369 PCAOB AS 3101.08 states that the first section of the auditor’s report must include a “statement identifying each financial statement and any related schedule(s) that has been audited” and a “statement indicating that the financial statements, including the related notes and any related schedule(s), identified and collectively referred to in the report as the financial statements, were audited.” 2370 2367 See supra notes 2337 -2339 and accompanying text. As the disclosure requirements we are adopting will be included in a note to the foreign private issuer’s financial statements and based on information that is recognized and measured in the foreign private issuer’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, they will be within the scope of the statement by the registrant’s auditor that the financial statements “including any related notes” were audited. Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20- F, and the forms that refer to Form 20- F (including Forms F -1 and F -3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements prepared in accor dance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, proposed Article 14 disclosure was nevertheless required (similar to disclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S -X).\""

              "'The Commission is adopting final rule s ( Item 1502(a) to require the disclosure of any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant. The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate -related risks. Commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but recommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the most likely and significant impacts. The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered “ an increase of no greater than 3 oC, 2 14C, or 1.5 1C above pre-industrial levels.” We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. g.G (g,g) (g),g.h (g,.g), g.H (g.,g), G.H. The final rule will require disclosure only when it evaluates and manages a climate -related risk identified in Item 1502(a) We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. The final rule will require disclosure only when it evaluates and manages a climate -related risk identified in Item 1502(b) We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. The final rules do not include “emissions” in the list of information that must be disclosed if necessary to obtain an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of a target or goal. We are not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by the EPA’s GHG verification process, and the registrant may choose to adopt a material disclosure strategy that is not required by the EPA’s GHG verification process. Final rule will require a registrant to include in its GHG targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal. 874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10 -Q. Proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHg emissions After the Compliance Date for GHG Emissions Disclosure but before the Compliance date for Assurance. We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant’s Form 10 -Q. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to use assurance standards they are already using for their disclosures. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be “suitable” Final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505, we agree with the commenters that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia’ The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant’s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal. Proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions. The proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to “mitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions” effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions have on a registrant’s financial statements. 10, 2023) (objecting to the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the impact of any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rule) The final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the absolute values of the relevant denominator. Final rules require disclosure of the amount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe weather events. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, and therefore disclosure would be required. The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events. We do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures.315 The final rules, by contrast, are responsive to investors’ need for decision -related risk disclosure, and we have used the proposed rule to describe the registrant’s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required.317 We have used the proposed rule to describe registrant’s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required. 378 Discussion In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact, a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters.375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long - term (i.e., 371 See, e.g. As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant’s climate -related goals as part of a registrant’s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material disclosure information for investors. Although similar co ncerns could arise with respect to Item 1502(d) ’s expenditures disclosure requirement, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright -line threshold, as was proposed for th e Regulation S -X amendments, and limiting the disclosure to material expenditures that, in “management’s assessment, ” are the direct result of mitigation or adaptation activities, will help to mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns. underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis disclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board as part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.557 Some commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly available scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”), the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), or the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), to enhance the comparability of the scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each registrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its disclosure accordingly.559 c. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is not required to disclose more information about the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing, including the scope of the registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing and the impact of such use on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant’s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b), and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant’s climate -related risks in order to make informed investment decisions. A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of climate -related offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the extent to which the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets or RECs ; the nature of the offsets or RECs ; and the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related emissions strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant’s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant’s business and financial condition. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure (120:1197 Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Disclosure Compliance Date Limited Assurance Compliance Date Reasonable Assurance Compliance Date LAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033 AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs) Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A AFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report under the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1) (i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant’s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). However, we agree that the proposed rule would not prohibit the disclosure of the registrant’s independence information with respect to the accompanying auditor’s fees, including the disclosure of the registrant’s GHG emissions data from the accompanying attestation provider.1370 Along those lines, existing Commission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2- 01 do not apply to the independence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or interpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly p resented under Item 1506 (which is a possibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2- 01), the guidance or interpretation would be a useful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371 We considered the concern raised by commenters tha t requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially increase costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant’s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant’s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagements for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered “Audit -Related Fees” for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -A, Item 14 of Form 10 -B, Item 14 of Form 10 -C, Item 14 of Form 10 -D, Item 14 of Form 10 -F, Item 14 of Form 10 -G, Item 14 of Form 10 -H, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -J, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -L, Item 14 of Form 10 -M, Item 14 of Form 10 Although not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their incentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would result in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential downsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted above,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the “suitable criteria” requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criteria” against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned “Climate - S - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol’s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as “suitable criter ia” against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3C emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute “forward -looking statements” for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : • 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); • 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); • 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and • 17 CFR 229.15(4) (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro mection CEMEX. However, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii, we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants ’ financial reporting obligations. Furthermore, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s, registrants should consider whether they currently have an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2) Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision - currently disclosure information about registrants ’ capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining “physical risks” to include “acute risks” (including severe weather events) and “chronic risks”); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of “acute risks” and included registrants’ expensed balances as a result of the beginning of the fiscal year (capitalized costs and charges incurred under the final rules (capitalized events and other natural conditions were disclosed to investors in the beginning of the fiscal year).2106 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant. The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. We have decided to include “significant judgments” as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures, and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures.2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions.'"

The final rules are responsive to investors\\u2019 need for decision -useful information regarding registran ts\\u2019 material climate-related risks. In addition, because a registrant may be able to assess the material risks posed by its value chain, this change will also limit the burdens of climate risk assessment on third parties. The final rules\\u2019 definition of \\u201c transition risk s\\u201d includes the same non- 323 See, e.g., letter from Chamber. Final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presented and the extent of the registrant\\u2019s exposure to the risk. Some commenters opposed proposed Item 1502 because in their view it would be difficult to distinguish between a climate -related physical risk and an ordinary weather risk. The final rule s include several changes from the proposal that mitigate some of the burdens of Item 1502(a), as it was proposed. The proposal would have called for specific information about physical risks, such as disclosures relating to flooding and the location of assets in regions of high or extremely high water stress. It also includes a non- exclusive list of disclosures the registrant must provide, as applicable, including whether the transition risk relates to regulatory, technological, market, or other transition -related factors. Describing the nature of an identified transition risk in this manner will help i nvestors understand the realized or potential material impacts. \\u201cover whatever time period is relevant to a registrant\\u2019s particular facts and circumstances \\u201d). Some commenters recommended bifurcating the climate risk disclosures into short -term and long- term timeframes, without a medium -term timeframe, similar to certain MD&A disclosures. One of those commenters stated that imposing a different temporal standard for climate risk disclosure would pose meaningful challenges. A s defined by the Commission and consistent with Supreme Court precedent, a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important. The materiality determination is fact specific and one that requires both quantitative and qualitative considerations. The Commission proposed to require a registrant to describe the actual and potential impacts on its strategy, business model, and outlook of those climate -related risks. Commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but recommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the most likely and significant impacts. Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule provision was not necessary because the Commission\\u2019s existing rules generally require a registrant to disclose the effects of material effects. The list, which is intended to be non- exclusive, includes, as applicable, material impacts on the registrant\\u2019s. If none of the listed types of impacts or any other impacts are material, a registrant need not disclose them. The final rule will help elicit more meaningful and relevant disclosure without overburdening registrants or investors. Corp. Gov. forward -looking disclosures,\\u201d438 which should provide registrants with more flexibility to determine the appropriate disclosures needed in response to the requirement. We also have eliminated the requirement to describe how any of the financial statement metrics or GHG emissions metrics relate to the registrant\\u2019s business model or business strategy. The final rules refer to the regis trant\\u2019s \\u201cbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition \\u201d rather than \\u201cconsolidated financial statements.\\u201d This is to reflect that the type of disclosure that is intended by this provision is more similar to that found in MD&A. The final Regulation S-X provisions that we are adopting, on the other hand, do not cover financial impacts caused by transition risks. This Regulation S -K provision, therefore, will elicit disclosure s about material expenditures related to activ ities engaged in for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate -related risks. The Commission proposed to require a registrant that has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate -related risk management strategy to describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks. The proposed requirements were int ended to help investors understand how a. registrant intends to address identified climate-related risks and any transition. to a lower carbon economy. Investors have sought more detailed disclosure about transition plans. A registrant\\u2019s transition plan may have a significant impact on its overall business strategy. The final rule does not list the types of transition risks and factors related to those risks that must be disclosed. We disagree with commenters who stated that this updating requirement would result in disclosure of information that is not meaningful for investors. We do not expect that it would be particularly burdensome for the company to disclose update d information about actions taken under the plan on a going forward basis. Disclosure of the steps a registrant intends to make under a transition plan, and whether it has taken those steps, will help investors assess the financial impacts of the plan. To avoid redundancy, a registrant should provide disclosure of material expenditures regarding the Item where, in its assessment, such disclosure is most appropriate. A registrant will not be required to comply with either provision until the fiscal year immediately following the fisca l year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status. 527 See 17 CFR 229.1503, discussed infra section II. F. investors about how a registrant intends to reduce its exposure to a material transition ris k while limiting the burdens on registrants.528 Modifying the transition plan disclosure provision to focus on material exp enditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions will help to mitigate this concern. 529 While the final rules seek neither to incentivize nor disincentivize the adoption of transition plans, we recognize that the compliance burdens of disclosure may influence some registrants\\u2019 decisions with respect to risk management practices. Investors have increasingly sought information from registrants about their use of scenario analysis and expressed a need for improved disclosure about such use. The final rule\\u2019s scenario analysis disclosure requirement will depend on whether and how a registrant use s such analysis. The rule will not require a ny registrant to conduct scenario analysis. We are, however, adopting modifications in the final rules. We have deleted from the definition the example that \\u201cregistrants might use scenario analysis to test the resilience of their strategies un der certain future climate scenarios, such as those that assume global temperature increases of 3 \\u00b0C,. 567 See 17 CFR 229.1502(f). Conversely, if a registrant conducts scenario analysis and determines from its results that it is not likely to be materially impacted by a climate -related risk, no disclosure about its use of scenario analysis is required. The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered \\u201c an increase of no greater than 3 \\u00baC, 2 \\u00bcC, or 1.5 \\u00b9C above pre-industrial levels.\\u201d We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. We decline to follow the recommendation of one commenter who stated that disclosure of scenario analysis should only be required when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative. g).g.g. g.g (G.g). G.G. (g.G). g.G (g,g) (g),g.h (g,.g), g.H (g.,g), G.H. (h,g,h), g,g. The final rule will require disclosure only when a registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing is material to how it evaluates and manages a climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) We are requir ing disclosure of this information because, as commenters noted, it will help investors understand a registrants\\u2019 internal carbon Pricing practice. We also have included a provision, similar to the rule proposal, stating that if the scope of entities and operations involved in the use of a described internal carbon price i s materially different than the organizational boundaries used for the purpose of calculating GHG emissions, the registrant must briefly describe this difference. We are adopting the proposed requirement s to disclose board oversight of climate -related risks. We are also adding Instructio n 1 to Item 1501 to clarify that in the case of a foreign private issuer with a two-tier board of director s, the term \\u201c board of directors \\u201d means the supervisory or non -management board. The final rule s will provide investors with the information they need to understand and evaluate those oversight arrangements. Proposal would require registrants to disclose board committee or subcommittee responsible for oversight of climate -related risks. Final rule will avoid generating detailed disclosure about matters that are not important to investors. Final rules balance investors\\u2019 need to understand board\\u2019s governance of climate-related risks with concerns that the proposal could inadvertently pressure registrants. The Commission is adopting the proposed requirement to disclose management oversight of climate related risks (Ite m 1501(b) with some modifications. The final rule s will, like the proposed rules, require that registrants describe management\\u2019s role in assessing and managing climate -related risks. However, we are limiting the disclosure required by this final rule provision to material climate-related risks, as suggested by commenters. ......... What do you think?

Visit CNN.com/Travel next Wednesday for a new gallery of photos. We agree with commenters that this information will be helpful to understanding a registrant\\u2019s ability to manage climate -related risk s. We emphasize that registrants are required to make this disclosure only if they have identified a material climate risk. The final rule has been modified to eliminate many of the prescriptive disclosure elements from the proposal. The Proposed Rule, if adopted, would present a costly distraction for companies with limited resources (particularly small- cap and many mid- cap companies) to attempt to align their behavior and disclosures with those of other companies. We are adopting a less prescriptive approach that focuses on a description of processes for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate -related risks. If a registrant has not identified a material climate -related risk, no disclosure is required. A materiality qualifier addresses the specific concerns expressed by commenters that the proposal would require registrants to disclose this information in a level of detail that would impose undue costs. We have removed several prescriptive elements from the final rule. The final rule will elicit disclosures that offer a more complete picture of the management of material climate-related risks. 780 See supra note 733 and 734 and accompanying text. reduce the prescriptiveness of the risk management disclosure requirement and streamline this requirement, as we have done with other areas of the final rule s. In response to one commenter who supported the proposal but cautioned against an overly broad application,781 we confirm that the final rules do not require registrants to speculate in their disclosures about future restructurings. If a registrant sets an internal target or goal that materially affect s or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition, then investors should have access to information about that target. We decline to follow the recommendation of some commenters that the targets and goals disclosure requirement should only be triggered by the board's or CEO's formal adoption of the target. The final rules do not include \\u201cemissions\\u201d in the list of information that must be disclosed if necessary to an understanding of the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of a target or goal. We are not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by the regis trant. Final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal. No update about targets or goals would be required if the underlying target s or goals are not required to be disclosed. 873 This provision will help to eliminate redundancies in the s ubpart 1500 disclosure. 874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. 875 A registrant may elect to provide disclosure regarding these additi onal items, but they are not required items of disclosure. In addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items. The final rules, including those pertaining to the use of offsets or RECs, are neutral regarding any strategy that a registrant may choose to manage a material climate-related risk. Proposed rules would have required a registrant to disclose its GHG emissions888 for its most recently completed fiscal year and for the historical fiscal years included in its consolidated financial statements. We proposed to define \\u201cgreenhouse gases\\u201d as carbon dioxide (\\u201cCO 2\\u201d); methane (\\u2018CH 4\\u2019); nitrous oxide (\\u2019N 2O\\u2019), nitrogen trifluoride (\\ufffd \\u2018NF 3\\u2019) and hydrofluorocarbons. Final rules include a Scopes 1 and 2 emissions disclosure requirement, although modified from the rule proposal. LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs will be required to comply with the final rule\\u2019s GHG emissions disclosure requirements. The TCFD recently reported that only 30% of North American companies surveyed reported their Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions in 2021. We acknowledge that registrants could incur costs to assess and monitor the materiality of emissions, even in situations in which they determine that they do not need to provide such information. We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. We are further limiting the GHG emissions disclosure requirement to LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs and on a phased in basis. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources. Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure. The final rules do not require an AF to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level. The benefits that assurance will provide in terms of investor protection and increased confidence in GHG emissions disclosure warrants requiring attestation. We recognize commenters\\u2019 concerns about the potential cost of obtaining assurance, the pote ntial shortage in the current supply of assurance providers, and the continually evolving state of assurance standards and methodologies. Several commenters urged the Commission to adopt the verification process for GHG reporting used by the EPA in lieu of the proposed assurance requirements. The practice of providing assurance over GHG emissions is far from nascent and is now expected by many market participants. We agree with commenters that requiring registrants to disclose whether they obtained voluntary assurance and related details w ould help those investors in companies that voluntarily obtain assurance. The assurance requirements in the final rules are narrowly tailored and limited to a subset of registrants, many of which already obtain assurance services. We disagree with those commenters that suggested we wait before determining whether to adopt a mandatory attestation requirement for GHG emissions. The phase in periods included in the 1221 See supra notes 1131 and 1132 and accompanying text. 1234 See CAQ, S&P 500 and ESG Reporting (Updated June 2023), available at https://www.thecaq.org/sp -500- and-esg-reporting. 1235 See, e.g., letter from INGAA. 1236 See supra note 1217. in the Proposing Release that limited assurance is not possible unless the assurance provider also believes reasonable assurance is possible on the subject matter. We expect that registrants\\u2019 ability to hire a non- accounting firm as a GHG emissions attestation provider and our decision to make certain modifications to the proposed requirements should help address concerns. The benefits of obtaining reasonable assurance are apparen t now and we do not expect those to change in the future. A number of commenters recommended that the Commission extend the phase in periods. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant\\u2019s Form 10 -Q. The final rules also extend the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emission disclosure to which it applies. The proposed rules would have required the attestation report to be included in the separately captioned \\u201cClimate- Related Disclosure\\u201d section in the relevant filing. However, as discussed above, the final rules leave the placement of climate -related disclosures, other than the financial statement disclosures, largely up to each registrant. Proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHg emissions After the Compliance Date for GHG Emissions Disclosure but before the Compliance date for Assurance. We believe registrants would be better served by such flexibility. We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. We. believe that the requirements we have included in the final rules will help ensure that GHG. emissions attestation providers have sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to execute the. attestatio n engagement. In addition, non- CPAs are not able to use the AICPA or PCAOB attestation standards. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirement for a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent with respect to the registrant and any of its affiliates. We view the independence requirements in the two contexts as providing similar, if not equivalent, protections to investors. The final rules model the factors the Commission will consider in determining whether a GHG emi ssions attestation provider is independent. The phased in compliance period will give registrants adequate time to find a provider that meets the independence requirements. The staff of the Commission\\u2019s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants or GHG emissions attestation providers. The likelihood of this scenario is reduced by the multiyear phase in compliance period we are adopting. The exemption from the GHG emissions reporting and assurance requirements for SRCs and EGCs provides most new ly public companies with time to develop any in- house expertise that may be necessary. It is possible that the application of the independence requirements in the final rule s may result in a GHG emissions attestation provider no longer being able to provide certain non- assurance services to its assurance client. IESBA stated that it \\u201cholds to the premise that sustainability assurance engagements... must be underpinned by the same high standards of ethical behavior and independence.\\u201d The Commission is amending Rule 436 to provide that a report by a n attestation provider covering Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions at a limited assurance level shall not be considered a part of the registration statement that is prepared or certified by an expert or person whose profession gives authority to the statement s made within the meaning of s ections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act. In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level. We remind registrants and providers that there are other remedies available to shareholders and /or the Commission. Proposed rules would have required the attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be included in the separately- captioned \\u201c Climate -Related Disclosure\\u201d section in the relevant filing. The Commission explained that the proposed requirement that the standards be established by a body or group that has followed due process procedures. The Commission is adopting the GHG emissions attestation engagement and report requirements with some modifications from the proposal. The final rules provide that the attestation report must be provided pursuant to standards that 1462 See, e.g., letters from ERM CVS; Futurepast; and Mazars. The propos ed rules also would have required the attested standards to be publicly available at no cost. In addition, it is important to recognize the value that investors have found in the voluntary assurance services currently being provided. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to use assurance standards they are already using for their voluntary disclosures.  ISO standards are widely used for GHG emissions assurance. We do not mean to imply that other standards, either those currently in existence, or those that may develop in the future, would not be suitable for use under the final rules. The Commission\\u2019s Office of the Chief Accountant is available to consult with registrants about whether a particular standard meets the rules. 1492 Therefore, the benefit of including the proposed minimum requirements would be marginal, at best, and could be viewed as redundant. 1493 We decided against including any additional requirements for the same reason. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be \\u201csuitable\\u201d Final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned \\u201cClimate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505, we agree with the commenters that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \\u201csuitable criter ia\\u2019 The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal. The decision not to adopt a requirement for a. registrant to disclose whether its GHG. emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will. eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required. Final rules require disclosure of \\u201cany\\u201d oversight inspection program that applies to the GHG emissions attestation provider. The AICPA\\u2019s peer review program and PCAOB\\u201ds inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs. We considered whether to only require disclosure about the existence of oversight inspections programs from registrants who engage GHG emission attestation providers that are not registered. See, e.g., Daniel Aobdia, The Impact of the PCAOB Individual Engagement Inspection Process \\u2014Preliminary Evidence, 93Acct. Rev. 53, 53-80 (2018) We are concerned that requiring this disclosure only with respect to certain GHG emission attestation providers could result in confusion. Final rules will require an AF or LAF subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose whether its former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned or was dismissed and the date thereof. If so, the regis trant must state whether during the performance of the attestation engagement there were any disagreements. The final rules also include two instructions defining the term \\u201cdisagreements\\u201d for purposes of the disclosure. The Commission proposed to require a registrant that was not required to include a GHG emissions attestation report under the proposed rules to disclose certain information. The final rules will not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions from any registrant. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures, the Commission is adopting a provision stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) constitute \\u201cforward -looking statements\\u201d T o the extent that disclosures made in response to these Items or to. any other s ubpart 1500 provision contain one or more of the following statements, they w ill fall. within the PSLRA statutory definition of \\u201cforward- looking statement \\u201d. For example, a. projection or estimate of a registrant\\u2019s future GHG emissions made pursuant to. Item 1504 would likely constitute a forward-looking statement. The PSLRA safe harbors do not apply to statements made in connection with an IPO, or related to the operations of a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program. The Commission recently amended Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b- 2 to define \\u201cblank check company\\u201d as a company that has no specific business plan or purpose. See Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, Shell Companies, and Projections. We have determined that it is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors to extend the safe harbor to these entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies. Extending the PSLRA safe Harbor to these specified disclosures will encourage more comprehensive disclosures under these Items. We are not using our exemptive authority to extend. the safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities. Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s. ection 21E(b). (ii) forward looking -statements contained in. a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company. The final rules\\u2019 safe harbor will not be available for forward -looking statements included in a registrant\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to provide a safe harbor from private litigation for such disclosures. The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: Financial Impact Metrics, Expenditure Metrics and Financial Estimates and Assumptions. Proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided additional transparency for investors. Proposed Expenditure Metrics referred to the positive and negative impacts associated with severe weather events, other natural condi tions, and climate-related activities. Commission also considered comments with respect to the proposed Expenditures Metrics. Proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions. Proposed Financial Impact Metrics focused on expenditures (spending) incurred in each reported fiscal year(s) The number of periods of the expenditure metrics should correspond to the number of years of income statement or cash flow statement presented in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign private issuers that file consolidated financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, would apply IFRS and the final rules as the basis for calculating and disclosing the financial statement effects. The proposed rules would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to \\u201cmitigate the risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions\\u201d effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions have on a registrant\\u2019s financial statements. Only those line items that reflect capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses fall within the scope of the disclosures. We do not expect that gross revenues would be impacted under the final rules. Final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks in the financial statements. Final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrant to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances. Instead, disclosure is required if carbon offsets or RECs have been used as a material component of a registrant\\u2019s plan to achieve disclosed climate -related targets or goals. Registrants are also required to disclose where on the income statement or balance sheet the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs are presented. Reform, Sunrise Project et al. ; and Deloitte & Touche. See also letter from Travelers (Mar. 10, 2023) (objecting to the proposed requirement for a registrant to disclose the impact of any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) on any of the financial metrics included in the proposed rule) The final rules provide that the disclosure thresholds should be calculated using the absolute values of the relevant denominator. The balances for these line items may represent debit or credit balances (which are not inherently either positive or negative) in the books and records. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose the capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events. Under the final rule s, registrants for which one percent of the absolute value of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit is less than $100,000 will not have to provide disclosure until the aggregate amount of expenditures expensed and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions. There is precedent in Regulation S -X for using $ 100,000 as a de minimis threshold. Final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules \\u2014stockholders\\u2019 equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit \\u2014 are aggregated amounts. Some commenters raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures. 2061 See supra note 1817. 2062 See, e.g., letters from BHP and Ernst & Young LLP. 2063 We have considered the feedback we received from commenters urging the Commission to forgo the one percent disclosure threshold. 2064 We agree that the concept of materiality plays an important role in the F ederal securities laws. U.S. GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards do not refer explicitly to climate - related matters, but registrants have an obligation to consider material impacts. The final rules ( Rule 14-02(g) require a registrant to attribute a cost, expenditure, charge, loss, or recovery to a severe weather event. Second, the \\u201csignificant contributing factor\\u201d principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor. Third, specifying an attribution and quantification principle in the final rules will reduce the burden associated with attributing and quantifying costs and expenditures. The final rules do not prescribe how a registrant must account for insurance proceeds in its financial statements. The final rules require a registrants to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed. A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of \\u201csevere weather events.\\u201d Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500. The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of \\u201cacute risks\\u201d and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as \\u201cchronic risks.\\u201d These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to regulation S -K. The final rules require registrants to disclose expenditures for specific transactions that are recorded in a registrant\\u2019s books and records during the fiscal year. The final rules provide a level of fl exibility that even a regularly updated, prescribed list of events would be unable to match. The acquisition and use of carbon offsets and RECs do not present the definitional or scoping concerns raised by commenters. Proposed Rule 14- 02(f), which would have require d the disclosure of expenditures related to transition activities. This commenter was referring generally to the Commission\\u2019s proposal to amend both Regulation S -K and Regulation S-X. The final rules also require a registrant to disclose where on the balance sheet and income statement these capitalized costs, expenditures expense d, and losses are presented. Final rules require disclosure of the amount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe weather events. In May 2022, the FASB added a project to its technical agenda on regulatory credits (such as carbon offsets and RECs among others) Assume a registrant capitalized $1,200,000 of expenditures related to Severe Weather Event A. The registrant used carbon offsets and RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve a disclosed climate -related target or goal. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, and therefore disclosure would be required. The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events. The final rules require the disclosure of expenditures expensed and losses \\u201c as incurred. transition plans disclosed by t he registrant. 2168 To reduce the potential burden on registrants, we have decided to narrow the scope of transition activities covered by this aspect of the final rule. 2169 Consistent with the 2164 See letter from BHP. 2165 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(h). 2166 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. Final rules will require registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed targets and transition plans. The final rules will provide investors with more decision-useful information about the estimates and assumption used to prepare the financial statements than is required under accounting standa rds. Final rules focused on discrete transactions that are currently recognized in a registrant\\u2019s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Current requirements under GAAP would continue to apply to material changes in estimates and assumptions. Final rules will not af fect existing filing obligations under Form 6 -K. The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed rules related to the disclosure of opportunities. The proposed rules would have required the disclosure of costs and expenditures to \\u201cmitigate the risks from seve re weather events and other natural conditions.\\u201d We do not expect that registrants will commonly incur costs, expenditures, charges, and losses as a result of severe weather event s or othernatural conditions in furtherance of an opportunity. The Commission is not adopting the proposed rules related to the voluntary disclosure in the financial statements of the impact o f any opportunities related to financial estimates and assumptions. The approach we are taking in the final rules will mitigate many of the concerns that commenters raised about the disclosure of opportunities. The final rules do not distinguish between \\u201crisks \\u201d and \\u201copportunities \\u201d Final Rule s After consideration of the comments, we are adopting the requirement ( Rule 14-02(a) to provide contextual information with certain clarifying modifications. We have decided to include in the text of the final rules two additional types of contextual information a registrant is required to disclose. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects. We disagree with the commenters who stated that requiring disclosure of contextual information would result in inconsistent and incomparable information that is not useful for investors. The final rule s intentionally provide flexibility to registrants to allow them to include contextual information. This will enable investors to compare judgments and assumptions made by registrants, including across industries. We are not aware of any cirstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP. The Commission did not propose such requirements and \\u2014although we do not necessarily agree with those commenters that stated requiring disclosure at a segment or geographic level would be too complex or result in the disclosure of irrelevant information. We think the approach to disclosure we are adopting strikes an appropriate balance between providing consistent, comparable, and decision- useful information to investors and the associated burdens to registrants. financial statement note as part of the audited financial statement s will allow the disclosures to be readily incorporated into the scope of the financial statement and ICFR audit s that registrants currently obtain.

Final rules focus on costs and expenditures for transactions that are currently recorded in registrants\\u2019 books and records and material financial estimates and assumptions. Final rules avoid many of the complexities associated with the proposed rules. We do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Abstractive Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"315 The final rules, by contrast, are responsive to investors\\u2019 need for decision -related risk disclosure, and we have used the proposed rule to describe registrant\\u2019s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required.317 We have used the proposed rule to describe registrant\\u2019s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required. Furthermore, adopting a climate -related risk disclosure rule that uses similar definitions (set forth below in Item 1500) and is based on the climate -related disclosure framework of the TCFD, with which many registrants and investors are already familiar, will assist in standardiz ing climate -related risk disclosure and help elicit more consistent, comparable, and useful information for investors and limit the reporting burden for those registrants that are already providing some climate -related disclosure based on the TCFD framework. 326 As discussed in more detail in section II.K.3.c.v, although Article 14 of Regulation S -X req uires a registrant to disclose certain financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which may include weather events that are not climate- related, subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K does not require the disclosure of material impact s from non -climate -related weather events. T he final rules provide that a registrant that has identified a climate -related risk pursuant to Item 1502 must disclose whether the risk is a physical or transition risk, providing information necessary to an understanding of the nature of the risk presente d and the extent of the registrant\\u2019s exposure to the risk.334 The final rules then provide a non- exclusive list of disclosure s that a registrant must disclose as applicable: \\u2022 If a physical risk, whether it may be categorized as an acute or chronic risk, and the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk;335 and \\u2022 If a transition risk, whether it relates to regulatory, technological, market (including changing consumer, business counterparty, and in vestor preferences), or other transition - related factors, and how those factors impact the registrant.336 333 See Proposing Release, s ection II.B.1. In such instances, the Commission indicated that a registrant should provi de a clear and consistent description of the nature of the risk and how it may affect a related risk, as well as how those risks have evolved or are expected to evolve over time.341 The final rules require a registrant to provide information necessary to an understanding of the nature For example, t he rule proposal would have required a registrant to disclose the location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the physical risk, and to provide the accompanying IP code or other subnational postal zone.345 The final rules we are adopting no longer require such disclosure and instead include, as one of the physical risk items that a registrant must disclose, as applicable, the geographic location and nature of the properties, processes, or operations subject to the identified physical risk.346 This revision is intended to address the concern of many commenters that the proposed ZIP code disclosure requirement would be burdensome to produce and would likely not provide useful information for many investors.350 This revision will give registrant s the flexibility to determine the granularity of any location disclosure s based on their particular facts and circumstances as long as they provide information necessary to understand the extent of water -related risks (the registrant\\u2019s exposure to such risks will be disclosed subject to a prescriptive approach ). This change was made in order to conform more closely to the definition of \\u201ctransition risks\\u201d in Item 1500, which refers to \\u201cregulatoryity, technological, and market changes.\\u201d Although this definition refers to impacts to a registrant\\u2019s liability or reputation as non -exclusive examples of negative impacts resulting from such changes, the definition of transition risks also refers to other examples of negative impacts that are not specifically mentioned in Item 1502(a)(2). The proposed rule provisions pertaining to governance, strategy, and risk management would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to describe any climate -related opportunities it was pursuing when responding to those provisions.354 In this regard, the Commission proposed a definition of \\u201cclimate -related opportunities\\u201d that was similar to the corresponding TCFD opportunity definition provided by the Commission. 378 Discussion In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact, a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters.375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long- term (i.e., 371 See, e.g. 438, 449 (1977) to further explain that an omitted fact is material if there is \\u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \\u2018total mix\\u2019 of info rmation made available.\\u201d). The \\u201creasonably likely\\u201d component of the rules we are adopting, as with the same standard in MD&A regarding known trends, events, and uncertainties, is grounded in whether disclosure of the climate -related risk would be material to investors and requires that management evaluate the consequences of the risk as it would any known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Disclosure Regarding Impacts of Climate -Related Risks on Strategy, Business Model, and Outlook 1. Final Rules The final rule provision (Item 1502(b)) will require a registrant to d escribe the actual and potential material impacts of any climate -related risk identified in response to Item 1502(a) on the registrant\\u2019s strategy, business model, and outlook.422 Information about the actual and potential material impacts of climate -related risks on a registrant\\u2019s strategy, business model, and outlook is central to understanding the extent to which a registrant\\u2019s business strategy or business model has changed, is changing, or is expected to change to address those impacts. For the avoidance of doubt, use of the term \\u201coutlook\\u201d is not intended to suggest that a registrant must disclose its earnings guidance or or forecasts in response to Item 1502(b). We have revised one of the types of potential material impacts listed in the proposal that referenced \\u201csuppliers and other parties in [ a registrant\\u2019s ] value chain, \\u201d by replacing this phrase with \\u201c[s]uppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts, to the extent known or reasonably available.\\u201d This revision is intended to address the concern of some commenters that requiring a registrant to include material impacts to a registrant\\u2019s value chain would be overly burdensome to both the registrant and to entities in the registrant\\u2019s value chain. 430 Thus the final rule limits the scope of this specific topic to include only material impacts to the registrant\\u2019s suppliers, purchasers, or counterparties to material contracts and further limits the information that should be disclosed about those impacts to information that is known or is reasonably available.431 The adopted provision is consistent with the Commission\\u2019s general rul es regarding the disclosure of information that is difficult to obtain, which will apply to the final rules if their conditions are met.432 Accordingly, as modified, this provision will help limit the compliance burden of the final rules by eliminating any potential need for registrants to undertake unreasonable searches or requests for information from their value chains. Under the final rules, as part of its targets and goals disclosure,441 a registrant will be required to provide disclosure concerning its use of ca rbon offsets or RECs if they constitute a material component of a registrant\\u2019s plan to achieve its climate -related targets or goals.442 Given this targets and goals disclosure require ment, explicitly requiring disclosure concerning the use of carbon offsets and RECs in the context of Item 1502(c ) is not necessary. We acknowledge the commenter who recommended that we delete the term \\u201cbusiness model\\u201d in the proposed disclosure item;443 however, w e have retained the use of th is term in the final rule because requiring a registrant to disclose a material impact on its business model caused by a climate -related risk will provide important information to investors about the effectiveness of the registrant\\u2019s climate -related risk management that would otherwise be lost were we to omit this reference. This will not only provide investors with important information about a registrant \\u2019s strategic decision -making concerning a material climate -related risk but should also help the registrant determine whether there are material expenditures that must be disclosed, thereby lower ing the compliance burden, as some commenters noted.452 This disclosure requirement is intended to capture actual material expenditures, both capitalized and expensed, made during the fiscal year for the purpose of climate -related risk mitigation or adaptation. As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant\\u2019s climate -related goals as part of a registrant\\u2019s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material information for investors. Although similar co ncerns could arise with respect to Item 1502(d) \\u2019s expenditures disclosure requirement, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright -line threshold, as was proposed for th e Regulation S -X amendments, and limiting the disclosure to material expenditures that, in \\u201cmanagement\\u2019s assessment, \\u201d are the direct result of mitigation or adaptation activities, will help to mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns. In addition, in responding to the final rules, registrants will have the flexibility to explain qualitatively the nature of the expenditure and how management has determined that it is a direct result of the disclosed transition activities, which may help alleviate concerns about potential liability exposure for attribution decisions.460 Requiring the disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that, from management\\u2019s assessment, directly result from mitigation or adaptation activities will also provide investors with important information that will help them understand a registrant \\u2019s transition strategy. 492 Another commenter stated that, due to the long timeline of transition plans, annual progress updates w ould in many cases not provide meaningful information for investors.493 This comm enter rule recommended that there should instead be a requirement to annually report any actions taken to achieve transition plans that are material to the registrant, as well as any material positive or negative deviations from the plan or changes to it that a re material to the registrant. 494 Another commenter stated that a registrant should have to update its transition plan disclosure only when the registrant believes it is appropriate to do so, and such updating should occur at most on an annual basis.495 c. Final rule After consider ing comments received, we are adopting, with modifications from the proposal, a final rule provision (Item 1502(e)) that will requir e a registrant to describe a transition plan i f it has adopted the plan to manage a material transition risk.496 Like the rule proposal, the final rules define (in Item 1500) a \\u201ctransition plan\\u201d to mean a registrant\\u2019s strategy 490 See, e.g. transition plan disclosure will have the flexibility to provide disclosure that addresses the particular facts and circumstances of its material transition risk.506 We also note that, as with scenario analysis and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant\\u2019s transition plan disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor. 507 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule requires a registrant to update its annual report disclosure about the transition plan each fiscal year by describing any actions taken during the year under the plan, including how s uch actions have impacted the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition. 516508 This updating requirement will help investors understand the registrant\\u2019s progress under the plan over time, track the impacts of a transition plan on a registrant\\u2019s business and, as noted by commenters, help inform investment decisions. In a modification of the proposed rule, which would have generally required the disclosure of the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage transition risk under a transition plan, the final rule will require a registrant, as part of its updating disclosure, to i nclude quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates a nd assumptions as a direct result of the disclosed actions taken under the plan.517 While this provision is similar to Item 1502(d), Item 1502(e) differs in that it is intended to elicit disclosure about material expenditures and material impacts on financ ial estimates and assumptions that directly result from actions taken under a transition plan (e.g., material expenditures made for climate- related research and development ). As recommended by one commenter,523 we have removed the reference to physical ris ks that was in the proposed rule.524 This change will make the transition plan disclosure requirement more consistent with disclosure that are based on the TCFD\\u2019s recommendation s,525 which may mitigate the costs and complexity of complying with t he final rule for registrants already familiar with the TCFD\\u2019s framework.526 A registrant that faces a material physical risk, however, will still be required to disclose how it is managing that risk as part of its risk management disclosure.527 These revisions will elicit material information for 521 We remind registrants that while they are permitted to cross -reference to information in their financial statement s to satisfy t heir Regulation S -K disclosure obligations, they are not permitted to cross -reference to Regulation S -K disclosures in their financial statements, unless otherwise specifically permitted or required by the Commission\\u2019s rules or by U.S. underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis disclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board as part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.557 Some commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly available scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\\u201cIPCC\\u201d), the International Energy Agency (\\u201cIEA\\u201d), or the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (\\u201cNGFS\\u201d), to enhance the comparability of the scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each registrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its disclosure accordingly.559 c. The disclosure of a registrant\\u2019s use of scenario analysis can provide important forward -looking information to help investors evaluate the resilience of the registrant\\u2019s strategy under various climate -related circumstances.560 Scenario analysis has increasingly been recognized as an important analytical tool in assessing a company\\u2019s climate -related risk. would be burdensome and costly to produce.564 We also note that, as with transition plan and use of internal carbon price disclosure, a registrant\\u2019s scenario analysis disclosure disclosure will be subject to a safe harbor.565 The final rule provides that, if a registrant uses scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate -related risks on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, and i f, based on the results of scenario analysis, a r egistrant determines that a climate -related risk is reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, then the registrant must describe each such scenario,567 including a brief description of the parameters, assumptions, and analytical choices used, as well as the expected material impacts, including financial impacts, on the registrant under each such scenario.568 We are adopting this disclosure requirement because, if a registrant has used scenario analysis to assess and manage a material climate- related risk, investors need to understand how it conducted that analysis in order to evaluate the registrant\\u2019s conclusions regarding material impacts on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. By requiring disclosure based on whether a registrant has determined to conduct scenario analysis as part of its consideration of material climate -related risks, a registrant will be able to select the climate scenario model or models that it believes best fits its particular industry or business, or its climate risk assessment approach. To further streamline the scenario analysis disclosure requirement, we have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information.575 We recognize that, as noted by some commenters, scenario analysis practices are still evolving,576 and that, in the early stages of use, a registrant\\u2019s disclosure regarding its use of scenario analysis may be qualitative. As a registrant\\u2019s use of scenario analysis becomes more sophisticated, we would expect its disclosure of the results of scenario analysis to become more quantitative, particularly when discussing the expec ted material financial impacts on the registrant\\u2019s business strategy, under each considered scenario, which, like the proposed rule, must be addressed should a registrant be required to disclose its use of scenario analysis. At the same time, we recognize commenters\\u2019 concern that, without a materiality qualifier, the proposed rule could have result ed in the disclosure of internal carbon pricing data that would require registrants to disclose more information about the registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing, including the scope of the registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing and the impact of such use on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is likely to describe how it uses an internal carbon price to evaluate and manage a material climate- related risk when responding to other final rule provisions, such as when describing a related transition plan, 229617 even if the description of internal carbon pricing is less detailed because it is part of a broader narrative discussion. have eliminated from the final rule the proposed requirement s to disclose the rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.618 By streamlining the internal carbon price disclosure requirement in this way and adding materiality qualifiers, the final rules will help ensure that investors receive material disclosure about the registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing to inform their investment and voting decisions while limiting the compliance burden for registrant s. 620 Because of these changes to the proposed rule, we believe that it is unnecessary to adopt an exemption or excep tion to the internal carbon price disclosure requirement, as some commenters recommended,621 or a separate phase in for the disclosure requirement, as recommended by other commenters.622 618 See Proposing Release, s ection II.C.3. Specifically, we are eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose: \\u2022 The identi ty of specific board members responsible for climate -related oversight; \\u2022 Whether any board member has expertise in climate- related risks and the nature of the expertise; \\u2022 How frequently the board is informed of such risks ; and \\u2022 Information regarding whether and how the board sets climate -related targets or goals, including interim targets or goals. While the proposal would have required this disclosure only to the extent applicable, we appreciate the concerns of some commenters who stated that these elements of the proposal could have unintended effects on the board\\u2019s governance structure and processes by focusing on one area of ris k that is disclosed 669 or influence the board\\u2019s transition process by focusing on one area of ris k that is disclosed 669. If a board of directors determines to oversee a particular risk, the fact of such ove rsight being exercised by the board is likely material to investors given other demands on the board\\u2019s time and attention.672 Moreover, unlike management, which likely oversees climate -related positions or expertise, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to investors, we expect that any risks elevated to the board level will be material to the company and limited in number. The final rule requires registrants to disclose information about their management oversight of climate -related risks, except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant\\u2019s principal line of business.708 c. The final rule requires registrants to disclose information about their management oversight of climate -related risks, except for opportunities unrelated to a registrant\\u2019s principal line of business.708 c. However, consistent with our overall goal to streamline the proposed requirements and to focus on management\\u2019s over sight of material climate -related risk, we are not including such additional disclosure elements in the final rule.710 We are adopting the proposal requir ing a description of the relevant expertise of position holders or members responsible for assessing and managing climate -related risk.711 While we considered the view of commenters that this could cause registrants t o feel compelled to find and hire management with such expertise, regardless of whether that is the most sensible use of managerial resources given the registrant\\u2019s particular climate -related facts and circumstances, the added qualification that disclosure is only required where the risk is material. , letter from Chamber (\\u201c We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk., letter from Chamber (\\u201c We believe the Proposed Rule, if adopted, would create a board oversight and risk management structure that not only makes little sense for certain companies but could harm investors in companies that have no need for such extensive oversight of climate ri sk. While supra registrants may be required to disclose certain climate -related information in filings made with the Commission pursuant to existing disclosure requirements, as noted above 730 there is a need to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of disclosures about c limate -related risk management for investors given that, as noted above, most r egistrants are not currently including the type of information called for by the final rules in voluntary climate reports or Exchange Act filings.770 We also considered comments that the proposal placed undue emphasis on climate -related risks and, as discussed below, have made a number of changes in response to streamline the requirements and focus on materia l climate - related risks. The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks.773 The final rule will require registrants to disclose any existing processes for the identification, assessment, and management of material climate -related risks. In addition, because the processes and factors that a registrant may use to identify the two types of risks may differ in certain respects, or in some cases a registrant may face one and not the other kind of risk, this change should elicit more relevant information for investors.775 Similar to the rule proposal, the final rule also provides that a registrant should address, as applicable, how it: \\u2022 Decides whether to mitigate, accept, or adapt to the particular risk;776 and \\u2022 785s whether to address the climate -related risk.777 The final rules will help investors to understand the processes that a registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing climate -related risks, consistent with the feedback of many commenters.778 In this regard, commenters further indicated that information concerning how a registrant prioritizes climate -related risks vis --vis other risks that the registrant is managing would be particularly useful.779 We are not, however, retaining the proposed requirement to disclose how a registrant determines how to mitigate any high priority risks.787 See Proposing Release, s ection II.E. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b), and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant\\u2019s climate -related targets or goals in order to understand and assess the registrant \\u2019s transition risk strategy and how the registrant is manag ing the material impacts of its identified climate -related risks. We recognize, however, as some commenters indicated, that an overly broad requirement to disclose any climate -related target or goal, even one that is meant for preliminary, internal planning purposes and that is not yet material, could impose a compliance burden on registrants that may outweigh its benefi t to investors.848 Conditioning the targets and goals disclosure requirement on the target s or goal s being material will help to address this concern by focusing the requirement on the information that is most likely to be decision- useful for investors. 856 See Proposing the proposed rule requires commenters s ection to meet its climate -related targets or goals.857 See Proposing the proposed rule requires commenters s ection to meet its climate -related targets or goals.853 These disclosures will allow investors to better understand a registrant s targets or goals and how it intends to achieve them, which will help investors better assess a registrant\\u2019s transition risks and make more informed investment and voting decisions. 859 Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule (Item 1504(c)) will require a registrant to disclose any progress toward meeting the target or goal and how such progress has been achieved.860 Also similar to the proposed rule, the final rule will req uire the registrant to update this disclosure each fiscal year by describing the actions taken during the year to achieve its targets or goals. Relatedly, the final rule will require a registrant to include in its targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal or the actions taken to make progress toward meeting the target or goal.863 This disc ussion must include quantitative and qualitative 859 See letter from Unilever. A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of climate -related offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the extent to which the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets or RECs ; the nature of the offsets or RECs ; and the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. 878 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812 and accompanying text.877 See supra notes 811-812. Relatedly, a registrant that relies on carbon offsets or RECs as a material component of its plan to achieve its targets or goals might need to consider whether fluctuating supply or demand, and corresponding variability of price, related to c arbon offsets or RECs, pr esents an additional material risk that is required to be disclosed when discussing its plan to achieve such target or goal pursuant the requirements of subpart 1500. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant\\u2019s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant\\u2019s business and financial condition. 891 The Commission also proposed to require a registrant to disclose its Scope 2 emissions, which, similar to the GHG Protocol, were defined to mean the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or 888 We proposed to define \\u201cgreenhouse gases\\u201d as carbon dioxide (\\u201cCO 2\\u201d); methane (\\u201cCH 4\\u201d); nitrous oxide (\\u201cN 2O\\u201d); nitrogen trifluoride (\\u201cNF 3\\u201d); hydrofluorocarbons (\\u201cHFCs\\u201d); perfluorocarbons (\\u201cPFCs\\u201d); and sulfur hexafluoride (\\u201cSF 6\\u201d). the Exchange Act annual report.1001 Commenters recommended varying GHG emissions disclosure deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10-Q.100 Commenters recommended varying GHG emissions disclosure deadlines for reporting GHG emissions, such as 120 days1002 or 180 days following the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,1003 or the due date for the Form 10-Q. We recognize commenters\\u2019 concerns about the potentially high cost of compliance associated with the proposed GHG emissions disclosure requirement, including Scopes 1 and 2 emissions,1009 as well as concerns about th e current availability and reliability of the underlying data for Scope 3 emissions.1010 To help address these concerns, instead of requiring, as proposed, the disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by all registrants regardless of their materiality, the final rules will require the disclosure of Scope 1 emissions and /or Scope 2 em issions metrics1011 by LAFs and AFs that are not SRCs or EGCs, on a phased in basis,1012 if such emissions are material.1013 1008 See, e.g. 1017 If a registrant is a n LAF or an AF other than a n SRC or EGC and its Scope 1 emissions are material but its Scope 2 emissions are not material, then, under the final rules, the registrant must disclose its Scope 1 emissions and is not required to disclose its Scope 2 emissions (and vice versa if its Scope 2 emissions are material but its Scope 1 emissions are not). A registrant\\u2019s Scopes 1 and/or 2 emissions may be material because the ir calculation and disclosure are necessary to allow investors to understand whether those emissions are significant enough to subject the registrant to a transition risk that will or is reasonably likely to materially impact its business, results of operations, or financial condition in the short - or long- term. These further limitations will help ensure that any registrants potentially subject to the final rule have su fficient resources and time to prepare for what we acknowledge could be a significant additional compliance obligation.1024 We recognize that many commenters supported the proposed requirement for disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions for all registrant s. Nevertheless, mindful of the attendant costs, we believe that the final rules present an appropriate means to achieve the primary benefits of GHG emissions disclosure, namely: providing investors with material metrics that will aid in the assessment of transition risk for those registrants that have identified a material climate risk ; and facilitating investors \\u2019 evaluation of a registrant\\u2019s progress towards achieving a material target or goal and the attendant effects on the registrant\\u2019s business, resul ts of operations, or financial condition. While the final GHG emissions disclosure provision will not apply to as many registrants or achieve the same level of comparability as may have been achieved under the proposed rules, on balance, we believe that, coupled with the other disclosures required under subpart 1500 and the structured data requirements of the final rules, investors will have sufficient information to assess the operational and financial impact of transition risks and strategies on registrants and compare such impacts across registrants. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure (120:1197 Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Disclosure Compliance Date Limited Assurance Compliance Date Reasonable Assurance Compliance Date LAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033 AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs) Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A AFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report under the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1) (i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. We considered the view expressed by some commenters that there is no reason to treat GHG emissions disclosures differently than other disclosures located outs ide of the financial statements, which do not require assurance.1210 Although we recognize that registrants may provide quantitative disclosure outside of the financial statements that is not subject to any assurance requirement, a s explained in the Proposi ng Release,1211 and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters,1212 GHG emissions disclosures are unique in that many companies currently voluntarily seek third- party assurance over their climate- related disclosures, and commenters, including investor s, have expressed a particular need for assurance over GHG 1207 See, e.g. See Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (Text with EEA relevance), available at https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_1222.01.0015.01.ENG (requiring companies within its jurisdiction to obtain limited assurance over sustainability reporting and sta ting that the European Commission will perform an assessment to determine if moving from limited to reasonable assurance is feasible for both auditors and companies); SB -253, Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (Oct. 1225 However, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules will exempt SRC s and EGCs from the requirement to obtain an attestation report.1226 Although some commenters urged the Commission to apply the final rules to all registrants,1227 not just AFs and LAFs, our decision to exempt SRCs and EGCs from the assurance requirement is d riven by our decision to exempt these companies from the requirement to disclose GHG emissions, which is discussed in greater detail above. Under the final rules, AFs and LAFs will be required to obtain limited assurance over their GHG emissions disclosure beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505 (the GHG emissions disclosure provision). For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, under commonly used attestation standards, both a reasonable assurance engagement and a limited assurance engagement have the same requirement that the subject matter (e.g., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) of the engagement be appropriate as a precondition for providing assurance. 1244 We agree with commenters that extending the phase in periods would provide registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers with additional time to prepare for implementation of the rules and would allow assurance standards and practices applicable to 1243 See supra note 1193; Brandon Gipper, et al. See also letters from GRI (\\u201cReasonable assurance should be adopted as this would be commensurate with the level of assurance provided through statutory audits of financial statements and will give information users increased confidence that t he reported information is prepared in accordance with stated criteria.\\u201d); and PWYP (\\u201cGiven the importance of GHG emissions data to enable investors to fully understand the climate -related risks of issuers, reasonable assurance is necessary to ensure that information is subjected to sufficient examination and verification such that it can be relied on by investors.\\u201d). As discussed above, the final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant\\u2019s Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates, or may be included in an amended annual report on Form 10- K no later than the due date for such Form 10- Q.1255 The extension of the deadline for the filing of GHG emissions metrics assurance also applies to the deadline for the filing of an attestation report, which should accompany the GHG emissions disclosure to which the report applies.1256 This additional time \\u2014an additional two fiscal q uarters \\u2014should provide registrants subject to Item 1505 and their GHG emissions attestation providers with sufficient time to measure GHG emissions, provide assurance, and prepare the required attestation report. Consistent with the notice requirements in cluded in Item 1505(c), the final rules (Item 1506(f)) provide that a registrant that elects to incorporate by reference its attestation report from its Form 10- Q for the second fiscal quarter or to provide its attestation report in an amended annual repor t must include an express statement in its annual Such filer would be required to follow the requirements of Item s 1506(b) through (d), including using the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, which was supported by one commenter.1264 Although in the Proposing Release, the requirements outlined in this paragraph would have applied to any climate -related disclosures not subject to assurance under Item 1506(a),1265 we have narrowed the scope of the final rule to apply only to GHG emissions disclosures that are not required to be assured under Item 1506(a) because, given the requirement in t he final rule material, we think it is unlikely that registrants will voluntarily obtain assurance over non -GHG emissions disclosure for which the disclosure required by 1506(e) would be useful to investors. 1359 We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. See 1592 See supra notes 1300 and 1301 and accompanying text. 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). 1361 Although, as stated above, we expect firms to adopt policies and procedures related to the expertise of its person nel, we have determined not to include such a requirement in the final rule s because we do not want to foreclose other possible means by which a firm may ensure that it and its relevant personnel meet the expertise requirements set forth in Item 1506(b). In this regard, we note that the IAASB and ISO standards, two of the four standards we are explic itly permitting assurance providers to use under the final rules (as discussed in more detail below), are not restricted to CPAs, and we are not aware that any state laws are currently impacting the ability of non -CPA service providers to provide assurance over GHG emissions. 1369 Namely, the final rules provide that a GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all iss ues encompassed within the attestation provider\\u2019s engagement, which is modeled on Rule 2- 01(b). However, we agree that the proposed rule would not prohibit the disclosure of the registrant\\u2019s independence information with respect to the accompanying auditor\\u2019s fees, including the disclosure of the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions data from the accompanying attestation provider.1370 Along those lines, existing Commission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2- 01 do not apply to the independence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or interpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly p resented under Item 1506 (which is a possibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2- 01), the guidance or interpretation would be a useful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371 We considered the concern raised by commenters tha t requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially increase costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant\\u2019s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). For example, with respect to its mining disclosure rules, the Commission stated that it was not adopting a requirement for a qualified person to be independent from the registrant because, among other thi ngs, the final rules require a registrant to disclose the qualified person\\u2019s affiliated status with the registrant or another entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, which is consistent with its mining guidelines. practice among some registrants of obtaining third -party assurance over their GHG emissions data.1381 Although generally the independence requirements in the assurance standards currently being used with respect to GHG emissions data are not as robust as the requirements in the final rules, many of these standards include requirements related to the objectivity and impartiality of the third -party assurance provider.1382 Therefore, the final rules\\u2019 independence requirement is not inconsistent with the general practice in this space of retaining an objective and impartial third -party to provide assurance.1383 In addition, we are adopting the definition of \\u201caffiliate\\u201d as p roposed and consistent with the feedback provided by commenters that addressed this issue.1384 Similarly, we are adopting the broad definition of \\u201ca ttestation and professional engagement period\\u201d as proposed, which is modeled on the definition of \\u201caudit and professional engagement standards\\u201d in Rule 2 -01.1385 As discussed in greater detail above, in response to a request for comment, some commenters recommended that the Commission require the GHG emissions attestation provider 1381 See supra note 1232. Although the final rules do not include a requirement that a registrant\\u2019s audit committee pre-approve the GHG emissions attestation services, nor was such a requirement proposed, it would be permissible under the final rules for a registrant to use the auditor of its financial statements to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagement, assuming the final rules\\u2019 requirements for assurance providers are met. See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant\\u2019s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagements for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered \\u201cAudit -Related Fees\\u201d for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -A, Item 14 of Form 10 -B, Item 14 of Form 10 -C, Item 14 of Form 10 -D, Item 14 of Form 10 -F, Item 14 of Form 10 -G, Item 14 of Form 10 -H, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -J, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -L, Item 14 of Form 10 -M, Item 14 of Form 10 Although not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their incentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would result in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential downsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted above,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment of an accountant\\u2019s report on unaudited interim financial statements included in a registration statement, which is also provided at the limited assurance level. 1399 However, we think it is nonetheless important that a GHG emissions attestation provider have some awareness about whether its attestation report is included in a 1397 In situations where GHG emissions attestation providers which are experts, t he amendments to Rule 436 will eliminate the potential for s ection 11 liability for those providers with respect to attestation reports at the limited assurance level. Further, to help facilitate registrants\\u2019 compliance with the requirement to file the letter from the GHG emissions attestation provider as an exhibit, we have included an instruction to Item 1506 that directs registrants obtaining assurance at a limited assurance level to Item 601(b)(27) ( as well as to paragraph 18 of Form 20- F\\u2019s Instructions as to Exhibits, as discussed infra note 1402 and accompanying text ). included in a registration statement.1403 We also note, as discussed above, that certain commenters stated that deeming the information expertized may have the effect of deterring or reducing available assurance providers.1404 We believe the approach we have taken appropriately addresses these co ncerns by exempting the GHG emissions attestation providers that perform limited assurance engagements from section 11 liability and the consent requirements associated with expertized reports, and requiring consent with corresponding section 11 liability only when the heightened level of review associated with reasonable assurance makes it appropriate for the report to be expertized. This bifurcated approach to reasonable versus limited assurance engagements is consistent with the current treatment of audited financial statements and unaudited (reviewed) interim financial statements.1405 While we recognize underwriters and other non- issuer defendants subject to potential liability under section 11 may face additional due diligence requirements during the transition 1471 See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the \\u201cframework on which management\\u2019s evaluation of the issuer\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment\\u201d)). See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the \\u201cframework on which management\\u2019s evaluation of the issuer\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment\\u201d)). See Proposing Release, s ection II.H.3 (stating that the \\u201cframework on which management\\u2019s evaluation of the issuer\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is based must be a suitable, recognized control framework that is established by a body or group that has followed due -process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment\\u201d)). 1475 This approach will not only reduce the costs of complying with the final rules1476 but will likely b enefit investors by leveraging the experience that GHG emissions attestation providers already have with particular standards, which could lead to assurance engagements being performed with a greater level of skill initially than if GHG emissions attestation providers were required to gain expertise with an unfamiliar standard. 1478 The ISO TC 207/SC7 is the technical committee responsible for the development of ISO 14064- 3 \\u2013 Greenhouse gases \\u2013 Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of greenhouse gas s tatements.1479 The committee includes members from 120 countries, each represented by the country\\u2019s national standards body, and the committee also includes representatives from 32 organizations who monitor standards development activities and can provide input during standards development. 1488 The final rules (Item 1506(c)) require the form and content of the GHG emissions attestation report to follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard or standards used, as proposed; however, in a shift from the proposal, the final rules do not prescribe minimum report requirements. 1489 The Commission expla ined in the Proposing Release that the proposed minimum components were all common elements of current assurance reports,1490 a point that was affirmed in the feedback we received from commenters.1491 We continue to expect that the attestation standards that meet the requirements of the final rules will generally 1486 See supra note 1430 and accompanying text. To the extent the AF or LAF disclosed Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for a historical period, it would not be required to obtain an assurance report covering such historical period in the first year of the attestation rule\\u2019s applicability. 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the \\u201csuitable criteria\\u201d requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \\u201csuitable criteria\\u201d against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned \\u201cClimate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol\\u2019s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \\u201csuitable criter ia\\u201d against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1505 This commenter asked the Commission to clarify whether, to the extent the Commission permits the use of standards other than those developed by the PCAOB, AICPA, and IAASB, the Commission should clarify \\u201cwhether all practitioners should be required to consider \\u2018other information\\u2019 in the same way as registrants.\\u201d 1503 The GHG emissions attestation provider must perform the engagement in accordance with t he requirements included in the attestation standard being used. Accordingly, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules require registrants to disclose certain information when there is a change in, and disagreement with, the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions attestation provider as discussed in greater detail below.1543 The decision not to adopt a requirement for a registrant to disclose whether its GHG emissions attestation provider has a license from any licensing or accreditation body will eliminate the potential for confusion about when disclosure is required, thus re ducing the burden associated with the final rules. The AICPA\\u2019s peer review program and PCAOB\\u2019s inspection program are two examples of types of oversight inspection programs that a GHG emissions attestation provider may be subject to generally; however, only the AICPA\\u2019s peer review program would include within its scope the GHG emissions attestation engagement. As stated above, the Commission included a request for comment in the Proposing Release asking if it should require disclosure when there is a change in, or disagreement with, the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions attestation provider that is similar to the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K.1558 The commenters that responded to the request for comment generally agreed with including such a requirement in the final rules.1559 Because we believe that requiring the disclosure of information regarding changes in, and disagreements with, a GHG emissions attestation provider would provide investors with important information about the provider and the conduct of the attestation engagement, which investors need to help them assess the reliability of the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures, we have included a provision in the final rules that will require AFs and LAFs subject to Item 1506(a) to disclose the extent to which the registrant\\u2019s former GHG emissions attestation provider resigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re -appointment after completion of the attestation engagement) or is dismissed. 1563 We have generally modeled this aspect of the final ru les on the disclosure requirements in Item 4.01 of Form 8- K and Item 304 of Regulation S -K, tailored to fit the context of 1566 This definition and explanation is consistent with Item 304 of Regulation S -K and its Instructions, with minor modifications to take into account the circumstances of a GHG emissions attestation engagement.1567 We have determined to take an incremental approach to requiring disclosure about the resignation or dismissal of a GHG emissions attestation provider and therefore have not included a requirement for the registrant to request the former GHG emissions attes tation provider to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the registrant with respect to the resignation or dismissal and disagreement (if applicable). The final rules, howeve r, do not preclude a registrant from disclosing its explanation of the dismissal or resignation to its former GHG emissions attestation provider, and although not required, we encourage any GHG emissions attestation provider to convey concerns it has with the registrant\\u2019s description of those events to the Commission\\u2019s Office of the Chief Accountant. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3C emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute \\u201cforward -looking statements\\u201d for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1504 (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro m CEMEX. For example, a statement of plans to transiti on to more efficient operations or a different mix of products or ser vices made in response to Item 1502( d), Item 1502( e), or Item 1504 (targets and goals) would likely constitute a forward- looking statement. For example, a statement of future economic performance made pursuant to Items 1502(d), Item 1504, or Item 303 of Regulation S -K would likely constitute a forward -looking statement. We also believe that a safe harbor for these disclosures wi ll help incentivize more comprehensive disclosures on these matters to the benefit of investors.1688 Statements made by i ssuers and /or in connection with transactions that will be eligible for the final rule s\\u2019 safe harbor include forward -looking statements that will be eligible for the final rule s\\u2019 safe harbor include forward -looking statements : made in connection with an offering of securities by a blank check company;1690 made with respect to the business or operations of an issuer of penny stock; made in connection with a rollup transaction; or made in connection with an IPO,1691 or in connection with an offering by, or relating to the operations of, a partnership, limited liability company, or a direct participation investment program.1692 1688 See supra note 1640 and accompanying text. 1689 In addition to issuers, consistent with the PSLRA safe harbors, the safe harbor will apply to: a person acting on behalf of the issuer; an outside reviewer retained by the issuer making a statement on behalf of the issuer; or an underwriter, with respect to information provided by the issuer or information derived from information provided by the issuer. We are not using our exemptive authority to extend the PSLRA safe harbors to: (i) issuers specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(1)(A) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(A) (specified \\u201cbad actors\\u201d); (ii) forward looking -statements contained in a registration statement of, or otherwise issued by, an investment company as specified in Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(B); and (iii) forward -looking statements made by an issuer in a going- private transaction, see section 27A(b)(1)(E) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(1)(E), in connection with a tender offer, see Securities Act section 27A(b)(2)(C) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(C), or in a beneficial ownership report required to be filed pursuant to s ection 13(d) of the Exchange Act, see Securities Act s ection 27A(b)(2)(F) and Exchange Act s ection 21E(b)(2)(F). Specifically, the Commission proposed that if a registrant is required to file the disclosure required by proposed s ubpart 1500 in a f iling that also requires audited financial statements, then the registrant would be required to disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated financial statement metrics.1704 The proposed rules would have required disclosure falling under three categories of information: \\u2022 Financial Impact Metrics;1705 \\u2022 Expenditure Metrics; and \\u2022 Financial Estimates and Assumptions.1706 The proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required disclosure of the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions and any efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise mitigate exposure to transition risks on the line items in a registrant\\u2019s financial statement. 1941, and we expect registrants to be required to disclose the impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions on the line items in a registrant\\u2019s financial statement. Moreover, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s,1942 the requirements we are adopting will provide many of the same benefits of transparency and insights that the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have provided, albeit without as much detail, which should reduce the burden on registrants. In addition, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii, we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants \\u2019 financial reporting obligations. Therefore, a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics.1946 Therefore, a registrant should consider whether it currently has an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. The final rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters. The proposed rules focus on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, which is similar to certain of the alternatives suggested by commenters. Although the proposed Expenditure Metrics only required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to the mitigation of risks from severe weather events and other natural conditions, the proposed Financial Impact Metrics would have required registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions because tho se costs would have constituted line -item impacts to a registrant\\u2019s financial statements. In response to commenter requests for additional clarity,2001 we are prescribing an attribution principle that registrants must use to determine whether a capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss is \\u201cas a result of\\u201d a severe weather event or other natural condition.2002 The attribution principle will also simplify the determination of the amount required to be dis closed by eliminating the need to allocate portions of costs and expenditures, which will reduce compliance costs for registrants.2003 Under the final rules, t he requirement to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions remain s subject to a one percent disclosure threshold; however, we are modifying the denominators used for the threshold and adopting de minimis thresholds that exempt disclosure of amounts that aggregate to less than $100,000 in the income statement or less than $500,000 in the balance sheet, as explained in greater Although we are not adopting the broader requirement for di sclosure of transition activities in the financial statements, registrants will be required to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to the purchase and use of carbon offsets and RECs in the financial statements.2011 The proposed rules identified the amount of expense d or capitalized 2008 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3. 2014 Furthermore, although the final rules under Article 14 do not require registrants to disclose costs and expenditures incurred to reduce GHG emissions or otherwise exposure to transition risks in the financial statements, the final rules under s ubpart 1500 of Regulation S -K will require registrants to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosure of material expenditures in certain circumstances as described in greater detail above,2015 which should result in the disclosure of some of the information for expenditures related to transition activities that we would have expected to be disclosed under the proposed rules, albeit outside of the financial statements. , ASC 230 Statement of Cash flows (requir ing classification of cash receipts and cash payments as resulting from operating, investing, and financing activities ); ASC 280 Segments (noting that a registrant \\u201cshall disclose both of the following about each reportable segment if the specified amounts ar e included in the determination of segment assets reviewed by the chief operating decision maker or are otherwise regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, even if not included in the determination of segment assets...(b) total expenditures for additions to long -lived assets...\\u201d ) (ASC 280-10-50-25); and ASC 730 Research and Development ( requir ing disclosure of the total research and development costs charged to expense in each period for which an income statement is presented) (ASC 730 -10-50-1). However, registrants may consider whether disaggregating material cash outflows to acquire property, plant, and equipment2020 purchased to meet the registrant\\u2019s transition plans, targets, or goals on the statement of cash flows or in a related note is appropriate to provide complete information about the entity\\u2019s cash flows for the period. Under the final rules, registrants are required to disclose the aggregate amount s of (1) carbon offsets and RECs expensed, (2) carbon offsets and RECs Proposed requirement or questioned what disclosure objective it was intended to achieve.2029 Because the final rules we are adopting are more narrowly focu sed on requiring the disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, we do not think it would be in keeping with this approach to also require a registr ant to disclose the impacts from any climate -related risks identified by the registrant pursuant to Item 1502(a). See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2) Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision -useful disclosure information about registrants \\u2019 capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. In a further shift from the propos al, we have included de minimis thresholds in the final rules.2047 As dis cussed above, some commenters expressed the view that the proposed one percent disclosure threshold would place an unreasonable burden on smaller companies because it is more likely that the impacts on smaller companies would exceed the one percent disclos ure threshold.2048 In addition, a few commenter s mentioned a de minimis exception in their letter s.2049 We recognize the possibility that a one percent disclosure threshold could be disproportionately burdensome for smaller companies or companies in the earl y stages of developing a product or business line for which one percent of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit or stockholders\\u2019 equity or deficit could be a very small amount. As discussed in greater detail below, the final rules also include an attribution principle that limits the required disclos ure to circumstances where the severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant contributing factor in incurring the capitalized cost, expenditure expensed, charge, or loss.2054 The final rules include de minimis thresholds, and the denominators used in the final rules \\u2014stockholders\\u2019 equity or deficit and income or loss before income tax expense or benefit \\u2014 are aggregated amounts and therefore we expect that in many instances they will result in a larger denominator than what was included in the proposal. Some commenters also raised concerns that the one percent disclosure threshold could confuse investors by giving too much prominence to the climate -related disclosures relative to the impacts of other risks disclosed in the financial statement s or could suggest a level of precision that does not exist.2055 However, the final rules require disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges e, and l osses that are currently recorded in the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP, and therefore the disclosures should have the same degree of precision as the other information provided in the financial statements. , letters from BHP (\\u201cFurther, while we acknowledge that the Commission currently uses a specific 1% threshold for certain disclosures, we note that the disclosure examples provided by the Commission are generally narrow in scope, factual in nature and limited to certain line items in the financial statements (for example, the amount of excise taxes included in revenue)\\u201d); Ernst & Young LLP (\\u201cBut we note that, unlike the climate -related impacts, excise taxes are discrete event charges that are easily calculated and tracked in a registrants accounting books and records.\\u201d); and IADC (\\u201cThe Commission argues that a 1% quantitative threshold is used in other contexts, but the examples the Commission cites are circumstances where the quantitative amounts involved are knowable under current accounting practice, have discrete impacts on specific financial line items, and address scenarios in which more detailed disclosure is appropriate. See also letter from CFA Institute (\\u201cWe would also observe that existing U.S. See also letter from CFA Institute (\\u201cWe would also observe that existing U.S. Second, the \\u201csignificant contributing factor\\u201d principle will strike an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure when a severe weather event or other natural condition was a significant factor resulting in the registrant incurring the expenditure or re ceiving the recovery, while not requiring disclosure where a severe weather event or other natural condition w as only a minor factor, thereby reducing the cost burden on registrants. 2076 See, e.g., FASB ASC 210 Topic 280 Segment Reporting, FASB ASC 323 Equity Method and Joint Ventures, FASB ASC 810 Consolidations, and FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. However, the final rules require a registrant to disaggregate certain costs and expenditures in the notes to the information that may be disclosed by a registrant such as a discussion of the composition of the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, or losses.2083 Similar to the final rules\\u2019 other disclosure requirements, a registrant will be required to identify where the recoveries are presented in the income statement and the b alance sheet.2084 v. Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions (Rule s 14-02(c) and (d)) A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide additional guidance to help registrants apply the meaning and scope of \\u201csevere weather events and other natural conditions\\u201d under the final rules, which we acknowledge are not required to disclose a portion of the registrant\\u2019s natural condition risks (i.e. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining \\u201cphysical risks\\u201d to include \\u201cacute risks\\u201d (including severe weather events) and \\u201cchronic risks\\u201d); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of \\u201cacute risks\\u201d and included sustained higher temperatures, sea level rise, and drought as examples of \\u201cchronic risks.\\u201d These remain unchanged in the final amendment s to Regulation S -K. We considered whether the non- exclusive list of examples should be expanded to include other types of severe weather events or other natural conditions identified by commenters in their comment letters;2095 however, we designed the list as non- exhaustive and non -exclusive because we thin k it is more appropriate to take a flexible approach to enable registrants to exercise judgment in identifying severe weather events or other natural conditions based on the impacts those events have on their financial condition. Some commenters asserted that allowing registrants to exercise judgment about which severe weather events or natural conditions to analyze would reduce comparability.2096 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant to every 2093 For exa mple, in determining whether high temperatures constitute a severe natural condition, a relevant factor may include average seasonal temperatures. to severe weather events and other natural conditions to carbon offsets and RECs, using the same trigger fo r disclosure in the amendments to Regulation S -K and the amendments to Regulation S - X will provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the registrant\\u2019s use of carbon offsets and RECs, which will help investors evaluate the role of these instrum ents in a registrant\\u2019s climate -related strategy and help them assess the likely financial effects of a disclosed material transition risk.2105 In addition, the final rules require registrants to disclose the beginning and ending balances of capitalized car bon offsets and RECs on the balance sheet for the fiscal year.2106 The beginning and ending balances of carbon offsets and RECs are an important data point for investors to understand as they assess a registrant \\u2019s transition risks. weather events and other natural conditions.2111 Under the final rules, registrants must separately aggregate the (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement to determine whether the applicable disclosure threshold is triggered and for purposes of disclosure.2112 The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses must be segregated between the balance sheet and the income statement depending on which financial statement the y are recorded within the calendar year. The registrant would determine whether the financial statement effects as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions would trigger the disclosure requirements based on the thresholds, as illustrated below: Expenditure Category Current Fiscal Year Balances (Stockholders\\u2019 Equity from Balance Sheet, Income or Loss Before Income Tax Expense or Benefit from Income Statement) Severe Weather Event A Natural Condition B Severe Weather Event C Percentage Impact Balance Sheet (capitalized costs and charges) $150,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,750,000 1.97% Income Statement (expenditures expensed as incurred and losses) $75,000,000 $750,000 $2,000,000 3.67% In the above example, the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event A was $1,200,000 (capitalized on balance sheet), the capitalized cost, charge, and loss incurred as a result of Natural Condition B was $1,750,000 (charge on balance sheet and loss in income statement of $750,00 and capitalized cost of $1,000,000 on the balance sheet), and the expenditures incurred toward Severe Weather Event C was $2,000,000 (expense in the income statement). Similar to the examples of disclosure that were included in the proposed rules, t he final rules state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of expenditure s expensed and losses as incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, relocate assets or operations affected by the event or condition, retire affected assets, repair affected assets, recognize impairment loss of affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2 The final rules also state that a registrant may be required to disclose the aggregate amount of capitalized costs and charges incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, for example, to restore operations, retire affected assets, replace or repair affected assets, recognize an impairment charge for affected assets, or otherwise respond to the effect that severe weather events and other natural conditions had on business operations.2121 4. Proposed Rule s The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and 2120 See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(c). The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. GAAP and IFRS require the disclosure of material estimates and assumptions in many circumstances,2181 including significant inputs associated with material estimates and assumptions, the final rules will enhance transparency and consistency by requiring registrants to disclose how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by severe weather events, natural conditions, and disclosed 2177 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.4. In addition, although we agree with commenters that the proposed requirements share similarities with critical accounting estimates,2182 we do not think those disclosures obviate the need for this requirement because the final rules go further by requiring specific disclosure about how estimates and assumptions are materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant. Proposed Rule s The proposed rule s would have permitted a registrant, at its option, to disclose the impact of any opportunities arising from severe weather events and other natural conditions, any impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities, and the impact of any other climate -related opportunities, including those identified by the registrant pursuant to proposed Item 1502(a) of Regulation S -K, on any of the financial statement metrics.2188 The Proposing Release explained that if a registrant makes a policy decision to disclose the impact of a climate -related opportunity on the proposed financial statement metrics, it must do so consistently ( e.g., for each fiscal year presented in the consolidated financial statements, for each financial statement line item, for all relevant opportunities identified by the 2185 See supra note 2157 and accompanying text. The requirement in the final rules to d is requiring capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed 2217 See Proposing Release, s ection II.F.3 (stating, in the discussion of the proposed Expenditure Metrics, that a registrant may choose to disclose the impact of efforts to pursue climate -related opportunities associated with transition activities but remaining silent with respect to opportunities for costs and expenditures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions). The requirement in the final rules to disclose capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and RECs was not included in the proposed rules because the proposed rules required the disclosure of costs and expenditures related to transition risks more generally, and therefore the proposed rules did not separately address opportunities related to carbon offsets and RECs. Proposed Rule s In the Proposing Release, the Commission explained that because the proposed financial statement metrics would involve estimation uncertainties driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, similar to other financial statement disclosures, registrants would be required to disclose conte xual information to enable a reader to understand how it derived the financial statement metrics, including a description of significant inputs and assumptions used, and if applicable, policy decisions made by the registrant to calculate the metrics. On the other hand, commenters raised concerns that certain of the proposed financial statement metrics would not necessarily comport with GAAP, including amounts for lost revenues, cost savings, or cost reductions.2246 In addition, in response to a question in the Proposing Release, certain commenters stated that the proposed financial statement metrics should be calculated at a reportable segment level when a registrant has more than one reportable segment, as defined by FASB Topic 280. We agree with the commenters who stated that contextual information will help investors understand the required financial statement effects.2252 The financial statement disclosures we are adopting may involve estimation uncertaintytie s that are driven by the application of judgments and assumptions, like certain other financial statement disclosures, ASC 210,2253 and therefore disclosure of contextual information will facilitate investors\\u2019 understanding of the financial statement effects and will be an integral part of the financial statements. We have decided to include \\u201csignificant judgments\\u201d as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures, and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures.2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions. We are also adopting the requirements ( Rule 14-01(c)) for registrants to calculate the financial statement effects using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the r egistrant\\u2019s consolidated financial statements and to apply the same set of accounting principles that a registrant is required to apply in preparation of the rest of its consolidated financial statements, consistent with the proposal. 2262 As the Commission explained in the Proposing Release, requiring registrants to calculate the financial statement disclosures using financial information that is consistent with the scope of the rest of the registrant\\u2019s consolidated financial statements w ill avoid potential confusion, maintain consistency, and aid comparability. 2263 In addition, we agree with the commenter who stated that applying the same set of accounting principles to the financial statement disclosures will aid comparability.2264 We are not aware of any cumstances where the final rules w ill require a registrant to deviate from GAAP, and therefore we are striking the words \\u201c[w]henever applicable\\u201d from the final rules, in response to the commenter who stated that this phrase was confusing because it could i mply that 2262 See 17 CFR 210.14- 01(c). We understand that a number of commenters raised concerns about applying PCAOB standards and stated that additional guidance would be needed.2359 The modifications made to the final rules to narrow their scope to capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses derived from transactions and amounts recorded in registrant\\u2019 s books and records underlying the financial statements and material ly impacted estimates and assumptions, along with the Commission\\u2019 s adoption of an attribution principle, will help to mitigate commenters\\u2019 concerns about the auditability of the disclosures. 2362 See supra notes 2306 and 2308 and accompanying text. However, PCAOB -registered public accounting firms will be able to apply sufficient, appropriate audit procedures to these disclosures as required by law.2366 Moreover, PCAOB - registered accounting firms are subject to periodic inspection by the PCAOB and are required to comply with PCAOB rules. 2369 PCAOB AS 3101.08 states that the first section of the auditor\\u2019s report must include a \\u201cstatement identifying each financial statement and any related schedule(s) that has been audited\\u201d and a \\u201cstatement indicating that the financial statements, including the related notes and any related schedule(s), identified and collectively referred to in the report as the financial statements, were audited.\\u201d 2370 2367 See supra notes 2337 -2339 and accompanying text. As the disclosure requirements we are adopting will be included in a note to the foreign private issuer\\u2019s financial statements and based on information that is recognized and measured in the foreign private issuer\\u2019s financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, they will be within the scope of the statement by the registrant\\u2019s auditor that the financial statements \\u201cincluding any related notes\\u201d were audited. Although Item 17 and 18 of Form 20- F, and the forms that refer to Form 20- F (including Forms F -1 and F -3) permit a foreign private issuer to file financial statements prepared in accor dance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, proposed Article 14 disclosure was nevertheless required (similar to disclosure required by Article 12 of Regulation S -X).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Final Summarization\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Commission is adopting final rule s ( Item 1502(a) to require the disclosure of any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant.

Commenters generally supported the proposed impact disclosure provision but recommended that the Commission add a materiality qualifier to elicit disclosure of only the most likely and significant impacts. The proposed scenario analysis disclosure provision would have included as an example of potential scenarios to be considered \\u201c an increase of no greater than 3 oC, 2 14C, or 1.5 1C above pre-industrial levels.\\u201d We have removed the proposed provision stating that the disclosure should include both qualitative and quantitative information. g.G (g,g) (g),g.h (g,.g), g.H (g.,g), G.H.

We are not adopting the proposed requirement to disclose any interim targets set by the EPA\\u2019s GHG verification process, and the registrant may choose to adopt a material disclosure strategy that is not required by the EPA\\u2019s GHG verification process. Final rule will require a registrant to include in its GHG targets and goals disclosure a discussion of any material impacts to the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition as a direct result of the target or goal. 874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of whether the registrant has set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant\\u2019s Form 10 -Q. Proposed rules would have required the GHG emissions attestation report required by proposed Item 1505(a) for AFs and LAFs to be prepared and signed by a GHg emissions After the Compliance Date for GHG Emissions Disclosure but before the Compliance date for Assurance. We have decided not to impose such a requirement at this time given the evolving nature of GHG emissions assurance and the possibility that new or different accreditation bodies m ay exist at the time when registrants subject to Item 1505 and Item 1506 are required to begin obtaining attestation reports. The final rules provide that any GHG emissions metrics required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1505 in an annual report filed with the Commission on Form 10- K may be incorporated by reference from the registrant\\u2019s Form 10 -Q. By making this modification to the final rules, we expect that many registrants and GHG emissions attestation providers will be able to use assurance standards they are already using for their disclosures. 1496 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we reiterate that prevailing attestation standards require the criteria against which the subject matter is measured or evaluated to be \\u201csuitable\\u201d Final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned \\u201cClimate - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505, we agree with the commenters that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \\u201csuitable criter ia\\u2019 The Commission is adopting the requirement for registrants to disclose certain additional information related to the attestation of a registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions with significant modifications from the pr oposal. Proposed Expenditure Metrics would have required registrants to disclose expenditures expensed and capitalized costs to mitigate the risks of severe weather events and other natural conditions.

Final rules require disclosure of the amount of (1) capitalized costs and charges on the balance sheet, and (2) expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement, during the fiscal year, as a result of severe weather events. The aggregate amount of expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the inc ome statement ($2,750,000) exceeded the one percent threshold of income or loss before income tax expense or benefit, and therefore disclosure would be required. The Commission proposed to require registrants to disclose whether the estimates and assumptions used to produce their consolidated financial statements were impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events. We do not think it would be necessary or appropriate to adopt a safe harbor for the financial statement disclosures.315 The final rules, by contrast, are responsive to investors\\u2019 need for decision -related risk disclosure, and we have used the proposed rule to describe the registrant\\u2019s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required.317 We have used the proposed rule to describe registrant\\u2019s climate -related risks as less burdensome than the proposed rule would have required. 378 Discussion In a change from the rule proposal, the final rule (Item 1502(a)) provides that i n describing any climate -related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact, a registrant should describe whether such risks are reasonably likely to manifest in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months) and separately in the long- term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months).374 This temporal standard is generally consistent with an existing standard in MD&A, which was recommended by some commenters.375 That MD&A standard specifically requires a registrant to analyze its ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its requirements and plans for cash in the short -term ( i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) and separately in the long - term (i.e., 371 See, e.g. As one commenter noted, requiring the disclosure of material expenditures that are directly linked to a registrant\\u2019s climate -related goals as part of a registrant\\u2019s strategy or targets and goals disclosure under Regulation S -K,453 instead of requiring the disclosure of climate -related financial impacts on line items under Regulation S -X, as proposed, will help reduce the compliance burden of the final rules while providing material disclosure information for investors. Although similar co ncerns could arise with respect to Item 1502(d) \\u2019s expenditures disclosure requirement, subjecting the disclosure requirement to materiality rather than a bright -line threshold, as was proposed for th e Regulation S -X amendments, and limiting the disclosure to material expenditures that, in \\u201cmanagement\\u2019s assessment, \\u201d are the direct result of mitigation or adaptation activities, will help to mitigate the compliance burden and related concerns. underlying the scenario analysis, as proposed.556 One commenter stated that scenario analysis disclosure should only be required when it is broadly used by senior management and the board as part of their strategic planning process and when integrated and material to a publicly announced climate -related strategy or initiative.557 Some commenters recommended that the Commission require the use of certain publicly available scenario models, such as those published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\\u201cIPCC\\u201d), the International Energy Agency (\\u201cIEA\\u201d), or the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (\\u201cNGFS\\u201d), to enhance the comparability of the scenario analysis disclosure.558 Other commenters stated that it should be up to each registrant to choose those scenarios that best fit its particular business or industry and tailor its disclosure accordingly.559 c. 616 If a registrant is required to provide internal carbon pricing disclosure under the final rules, the registrant is not required to disclose more information about the registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing, including the scope of the registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing and the impact of such use on the registrant, including on its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.607 As commenters have noted, many registrants use i nterna l carbon pricing as a planning tool, among other purposes : to help identify climate -related risks and opportunities ; as an incentive to drive energy efficiencies to reduce costs ; to quantify the potential costs the company would incur should a carbon tax be put into effect ; and to guide capital investment decisions.608 Information about a registrant\\u2019s use of internal carbon pricing will help investors evaluate how a registrant is managing climate -related risk s, particularly transition risk s, and the effecti veness of its business strategy to mitigate or adapt to such risk s. Also similar to the rule proposal, the final rule provides that, i f a registrant is managing a material climate -related risk, it must disclose The Overall Disclosure Requirement (Item 1504(a), (b), and (c)) The final rule (Item 1504 (a)) will require a registrant to disclose any climate -related target or goal if such target or goal has materially affected or i s reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant\\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.847 Investors need detailed information about a registrant\\u2019s climate -related risks in order to make informed investment decisions. A regis trant will not be required to comply with the requirements of Item 1504(c)(2) until the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year of its initial compliance date for the s ubpart 1500 rules based on its filer status.874 We decline to follow the recomm endation of some commenters to require the disclosure of climate -related offsets or RECs in order to evaluate the extent to which the registrant has set science- based GHG emission reduction targets or RECs ; the nature of the offsets or RECs ; and the extent to which it can achieve its targets or goals using existing technology. At the recommendation of commenters, in addition to carbon reduction, we have added the amount of carbon avoidance and carbon removal 881 represented by carbon offsets as disclosure items to clarify that disclosure is required about offsets representing carbon removal and those representing carbon avoidance or reduction if the registrant has u sed these types of offsets as a material part of its climate -related emissions strategy.882 This addition will help investors assess the risks associated with the different types of offsets used and how they may affect a registrant\\u2019s transition risk management and t he related impacts on the registrant\\u2019s business and financial condition. Presentation of the GHG Emissions Metrics and Disclosure of Under the final rules, the attestation engagement must, at a minimum, be at the f ollowing assurance level for the indicated fiscal year for the required GHG emissions disclosure (120:1197 Filer Type Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Disclosure Compliance Date Limited Assurance Compliance Date Reasonable Assurance Compliance Date LAFs Fiscal year 2026 Fiscal year 2029 Fiscal year 2033 AFs (other than SRCs and EGCs) Fiscal year 2028 Fiscal year 2031 N/A AFs (excluding SRCs and EGCs) and LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report under the final rules,1198 consistent with the scope of registrants that are required to comply with the GHG emissions disclosure requirements in Item 1505.1199 As illustrated in the table above, the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1) (i), (ii)) require both AFs and LAFs to obtain limited assurance beginning the third fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505; however, under the final rules (Item 1506(a)(1)(iii)), only LAFs are required to obtain an attestation report at a reasonable assurance level beginning the seventh fiscal year after the compliance date for Item 1505. For example, in a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed by attestation provider s are generally limited to analytical procedures and inquiries, 1238 but in a reasonable assurance engagement, they are also required to perform risk assessment and detail testing procedures to respond to the assessed risk.1239 However, the outcome of a reason able assurance engagement results in positive assurance (e.g., the provider forms an opinion about whether the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions disclosures are in accordance with Item 1505 in all material respects) while the outcome of a limited assurance engage ment results in negative assurance (e.g., the provider forms a conclusion about whether it is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the disclosures for it to be in accordance with Item 1505). However, we agree that the proposed rule would not prohibit the disclosure of the registrant\\u2019s independence information with respect to the accompanying auditor\\u2019s fees, including the disclosure of the registrant\\u2019s GHG emissions data from the accompanying attestation provider.1370 Along those lines, existing Commission guidance and staff interpretations regarding Rule 2- 01 do not apply to the independence requirements in Item 1506; however, to the extent any such guidance or interpretation may apply to an issue that is similarly p resented under Item 1506 (which is a possibility since Item 1506 is modeled on Rule 2- 01), the guidance or interpretation would be a useful starting point for consideration, although not determinative.1371 We considered the concern raised by commenters tha t requiring a GHG emissions attestation provider to be independent would limit the available pool of providers and potentially increase costs.1372 However, we think these concerns are In response to the commenters that pointed out that the Commission did not adopt a requirement to retain an independent third party to prepare, or conduct a reserves audit of, a registrant\\u2019s reserves estimates in the context of its mining and oil and gas disclosure rules, 1377 we 1376 See 17 CFR 229.1506(b)(2)(ii)(A). See also supra note 1280 (explaining that if the independent accountant who audits the registrant\\u2019s consolidated financial statements is also engaged to perform the GHG emissions attestation engagements for the same filing, the fees associated with the GHG emissions attestation engagement would be considered \\u201cAudit -Related Fees\\u201d for purposes of Item 9(e) of 17 CFR 240.14a -101, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -A, Item 14 of Form 10 -B, Item 14 of Form 10 -C, Item 14 of Form 10 -D, Item 14 of Form 10 -F, Item 14 of Form 10 -G, Item 14 of Form 10 -H, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -J, Item 14 of Form 10 -K, Item 14 of Form 10 -L, Item 14 of Form 10 -M, Item 14 of Form 10 Although not subjecting providers of these reports to liability could affect their incentives, on balance we think that encouraging more providers to enter this market would result in more competition, which would benefit investors.1397 We acknowledge the potential downsides of not subjecting the providers of these reports to liability; however, as noted above,1398 these accommodations are consistent with the treatment 1495 In response to a request for comment, a few commenters agreed that a reference to proposed Item 1504 would meet the \\u201csuitable criteria\\u201d requirement under the prevailing attestation standard and that the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \\u201csuitable criteria\\u201d against which Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. 1502 As explained above in section II.H.3, in a modification from the proposal, the final rules will not require that GHG emissions disclosure be provided in a separately captioned \\u201cClimate - S - 1499 In addition, to the extent an AF or LAF chooses to disclose its Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions pursuant to Item 1505 and leverages the GHG Protocol\\u2019s methodologies, we agree with the commenters that stated the provisions of the GHG Protocol would qualify as \\u201csuitable criter ia\\u201d against which the Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure should be evaluated. Instead, for the reasons discussed below and consistent with the feedback from commenters that asked the Commission to promulgate a safe harbor for certain climate -related disclosures (in addition to the Scope 3C emissions disclosure safe harbor that was proposed ),1674 we are adopting a provision (Item 1507) stating that disclosure s (other than historic facts) provided pursuant to the following s ubpart 1500 provisions constitute \\u201cforward -looking statements\\u201d for purposes of the PSLRA safe harbors : \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(e) (transition plans); \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(f) (scenario analysis); \\u2022 17 CFR 229.1502(g) (internal carbon pricing); and \\u2022 17 CFR 229.15(4) (targets and goals).1675 In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rules provide that the PSLRA safe harbors will apply to these forward- looking statements in connection with certain transactions and disclosures by certain issuers notwithstanding that these transac tions and issuers are 1671 See letter fro mection CEMEX. However, as discussed in greater detail below in s ection II.K.3.c.ii, we emphasize that registrants currently have an obligation under GAAP to consider material impacts on the financial statement s, and the fact that the impact may be driven by climate -related matters does not alter registrants \\u2019 financial reporting obligations. Furthermore, given the overlapping nature of some of the disclosures that would have been required by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics and the capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses that are required to be disclosed under the final rule s, registrants should consider whether they currently have an obligation to disclose information that would have been covered by the proposed Financial Impact Metrics. See 17 CFR 210.14- 02(b)(2) Although the final rule is more narrow in scope than the proposal, the information elicited by the final rules will provide investors with comparable, reliable, and decision - currently disclosure information about registrants \\u2019 capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, a nd losses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, which will serve to protect investors, while minimizing costs and burdens on registrants. S ince the line items we have chosen for the denominators in the fina l rules are well known and represent aggregated financial activity, we expect at least some companies will have insight into the expected amount or magnitude of these denominators in advance of the end of the fiscal year, which could help facilitate the es tablishment of internal accounting 2037 For example, while some registrants are not explicitly required to present income or loss before income tax expense or benefit in accordance with 17 CFR 210.5- 03.10 in their financial statements, U.S. Requiring such a determination for severe weather events or other natural conditions was not the intent of the proposed amendments to 2087 See 17 CFR 229.1500 (defining \\u201cphysical risks\\u201d to include \\u201cacute risks\\u201d (including severe weather events) and \\u201cchronic risks\\u201d); and 17 CFR 210.14- 02 (c), (d), and (h). The proposed amendm ents to Regulation S - K included hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires as examples of \\u201cacute risks\\u201d and included registrants\\u2019 expensed balances as a result of the beginning of the fiscal year (capitalized costs and charges incurred under the final rules (capitalized events and other natural conditions were disclosed to investors in the beginning of the fiscal year).2106 Although more prescriptive requirements can increase comparability, our view is that greater flexibility for registrants to determine which severe weather events and other natural conditions affect them in light of their particular facts and circumstances will yield better disclosures for investors compared to a static list of potential events that may or may not be relevant. The final rules require registrants to disclos e whether the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements were materially impacted by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, 2172 flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, or any climate -related targets or transition plans disclosed by the registrant.2173 If so, then consistent with the proposed rule s, the final rules require registrants to provide a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions were impacted by the events, conditions, and disclosed targets or transition plans identi fied above. We have decided to include \\u201csignificant judgments\\u201d as an additional type of contextual information in the final rules because registrants will need to exercise judgment when preparing their disclosures, and disclosing contextual information about those judgments will help investors understand and evaluate the reasonableness of the disclosures.2255 Given the narrower scope of the disclosure requirements that we are adopting, we expect that the final rules require fewer inputs and assumptions than would have been required under the proposal ; however, we are retaining the references to inputs and assumptions in the final rules because it is possible, though less likely, that preparation of t he financial statement disclosures could involve estimation uncertainty and require the registrant to exercise judgment in the selection of inputs and assumptions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
